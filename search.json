    "text": "Faculty members understand the pressure that a possible interruption of classes puts on students and their families. The DFA is doing its best to get back to the table and negotiate an agreement. In the meantime, we know you have questions and we have done our best to answer them here. If there are other questions you have, please send them along to 2025.strike.dfa@dal.ca and we will do our best to answer them.\n\nAre the DFA and Dalhousie Board of Governors still at the bargaining table?\nThe DFA has asked the Board repeatedly to come back to the bargaining table. So far, the Board has refused to bargain more than a handful of times. The last meeting took place July 16 and the Board has been unwilling to come back to the bargaining table since then to try and negotiate an agreement.\nDFA President Dave Westwood contacted Dalhousie President Kim Brooks on June 28 in an attempt to get the two sides back to the table. President Brooks was unable to accommodate a meeting due to her busy summer schedule.\nBoth sides are scheduled to meet with the conciliator on Monday, August 11 to try and reach an agreement before any job action is taken.\n\n\nAre faculty members going to strike? And if so, when would it happen?\nWhen talking about “job action”, it is important to note the difference between a strike and a lockout.\nA lockout is a situation where an employer temporarily closes a workplace or suspends work to pressure employees or their union to accept specific employment terms: equally importantly the employer stops paying the workers. It’s a form of employer-driven leverage in labour disputes.\nA strike is a work stoppage where employees collectively refuse to work to exert pressure on their employer during contract negotiations: the employer would stop paying workers during a strike. The purpose of a strike is to disrupt normal business operations and compel the employer to meet their demands.\nFor students, the end result is same – work by DFA members stops.\nThe DFA has no intention of triggering a strike in August. We want students in classes this summer to continue their studies uninterrupted. We also want students coming for the fall term to have chance to move in and get settled.\nAny work stoppage in August will be the result of the Board choosing to lockout DFA Members. If the Board decides to make that move, the earliest you could expect job action is August 12.\n\n\nWhat is the DFA asking for?\nThere are many issues that have not been agreed to at the table, the main ones are:\nThe Board wants to change the collective agreement to allow more teaching to be done by precarious sessional and contract instructors. Sessional and contract faculty are paid far less than full-time positions and they do not receive the same benefits, and most of them do not conduct research.\nThe DFA is asking for reasonable salary increases, in line with what other universities pay their teachers, scholars, and librarians. The Board is demanding that DFA accept wages below inflation, which amounts to a wage cut.\nSalary that does not keep pace with inflation, and an increase in classes being taught by sessional and contract faculty will continue to chip away at the academic mission of Dalhousie. We know our working conditions are your learning conditions and we want to keep Dalhousie strong. To do that the DFA is asking for a fair contract for its members.\nTo learn more about the DFA’s bargaining positions, read Student Update #2.\n\n\nIf there is a work stoppage, how long will it last?\nIn the last four rounds of bargaining (2021,2017, 2020 and 2022), the DFA and the Board reached agreement in conciliation. (Conciliation is a common part of the bargaining process where a provincially-appointed conciliation officer works with both sides to try and find an agreement. If conciliation fails, either side can initiate job action – a lockout by the employer, or a strike by the union.) We are hopeful that we can reach agreement without work stoppage again this year.\nThe Dalhousie Board has never locked out faculty. For Dalhousie to do so this year would be an unprecedented move among the leading 15 research-intensive universities in Canada. If they do indeed initiate a lockout, we have no idea how long they would keep us locked out.\nThe DFA has not been on strike since 2002. The strike lasted almost four weeks. In Canada’s post-secondary sector, the average length of a strike is three weeks.\nIf labour disruption occurs, it could jeopardize the fall term depending on how long it lasts.\n\n\nIf there is a work stoppage, what activities will be interrupted?\nThe list of activities at all campuses that will be interrupted includes:\n\nAll in-person and online classes taught by approximately 1000 DFA professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors would be cancelled;\nAccess to course materials, tests, grading, and communication with students on academic matters would be cancelled;\nSenate will be suspended;\nSupervision of research students (both undergraduate and graduate) will be paused;\nThesis defences, other presentations, and access to librarians will stop;\nThere will be reduced access to some counselling services.\nInternships and practica may be disrupted depending on the specific details and supervisory responsibilities. \n\n\n\nCan I cross the picket line?\nThere will be picket lines at various places around campus in Halifax and Truro. To get to the campus you may have to cross the picket line. Our faculty members will not prevent you from doing so.\n\n\nHow can students keep their studies moving forward?\nIf a lockout occurs this summer, and you are taking classes, we suggest that you treat the temporary cessation of classes like a “working study break” and continue reading, studying, learning, writing papers, etc. Ask your professor or instructor for specific examples of what you can do to prepare for job action. Do this before August 11, the earliest date faculty could be locked out.\nIf you will not be in class until the fall semester, the best thing you can do is monitor the situation by checking our social media platforms (see below) and our website https://wearedal.ca.\nWhen classes resume, faculty will try to work out a revised completion of courses that is fair and reasonable. If work stoppage occurs, it could jeopardize the fall term depending on how long it lasts.\n\n\nIf I am travelling to start the fall term, should I still come to Halifax/Truro?\nDFA urges students to keep informed on how the situation is unfolding. Our picket lines will not prevent you from moving into residence although there could be delays while the picket lines are operating (Monday to Friday, 730 am – 400 pm).\nIf there is a lockout that begins in August, there is a high probability that the start of the fall semester will be delayed so you might want to plan your travel to campus accordingly. If you are considering changing your travel plans to Halifax, we advise sharing this information with Dalhousie’s student services leaders as this could encourage a faster resolution to the work stoppage.\n\n\nAs a student, is there anything I can do to help avoid labour disruption?\nThe Dalhousie Student Union is considering a motion for academic amnesty to the Senate for those students who might feel uncomfortable crossing picket lines to attend classes that may be held by sessional instructors.\nWe encourage you to voice your concerns to the Vice-Provost of Student Affairs Rick Ezekiel via email rick.ezekiel@dal.ca or Assistant Vice-Provost Student Engagement and Success Quenta Adams via email quenta.adams@dal.ca\nIf work stoppage occurs, and you see our DFA members walking the line, you are always welcome to show your support and join them on the picket lines.  We have no idea how long a lockout would last, and the more support we have on the picket lines, the stronger we will be."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is Part 1 of our Student Update, providing key information about the contract negotiations happening between Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) and the Dalhousie Board of Governors. Part 2 will be available in the coming weeks and is designed for those students wondering about the issues at the heart of this round of collective bargaining.\nThe Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) is the collective bargaining agent for almost 1000 faculty members at Dalhousie, including professors, instructors, librarians and counsellors.\n\n2025 Collective Bargaining\nThe DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors began negotiations on May 26, 2025. On June 2, after only a few days of bargaining, the Dalhousie Board unexpectedly filed for conciliation. The DFA contested the filing, saying it was too early in the process and full discussions on many proposals had not yet taken place. The Minister of Labour agreed to wait until the DFA Bargaining Team and the Board’s team met one last time on Friday, June 20, 2025.\nOn June 23, the Labour Board appointed Mr. Rick Rose as the conciliation officer. Conciliation begins July 9. Outstanding issues will be discussed during conciliation and we are unable to share details at this time. You have undoubtedly read much of the Board’s narrative about the financial situation they are in. Like most post-secondary institutions across Canada, Dalhousie is facing financial challenges that are created by several external factors beyond our direct control. In bargaining, the DFA has asked the Board to walk us through their current financial situation so that we can be certain that we understand exactly what these impacts look like today and in the near future. Several aspects of the operating budget remain mysterious and we await further explanation and clarification.\nThe DFA has conducted external reviews of Dalhousie’s Financial Statements for many years. The Board has a long-standing history of moving substantial funds out of the operating budget and into capital projects. Between 2003 and 2021, for example, Dalhousie’s audited financial statements show a cumulative operating surplus of more than $464M.\nEven if Dalhousie’s revenues are down as much as we are being told, there is plenty of money available to fund adequate cost-of-living adjustments for all Dalhousie employees, including professors, instructors, librarians and counsellors.\nThe Conciliation Process As is typical in bargaining, the conciliator meets with both sides to try and reach agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the conciliator files a “no board report” with the Minister of Labour, which triggers a 14-day countdown. At the end of that 14-day period, job action can begin, which means the Dalhousie Administration could lock out DFA faculty members, or the DFA could go on strike. Questions You May Have Are faculty members going to strike? And if so, when would it happen? From June 23 to July 4, the DFA held a strike vote. Over 85% of DFA members voted, and over 91% of those voting supported going on strike if necessary. This does not mean that there will be a strike, but rather that the faculty is prepared to go on strike if no agreement is reached during conciliation. The DFA Bargaining Team and leadership are committed to reaching a settlement without job action. We will continue bargaining in good faith and do our best to secure a fair agreement for our members without job action which causes unwanted disruption for faculty and students, alike. That said, at this point, the earliest you might expect job action (lock-out initiated by the Board of Governors, or strike initiated by the DFA) is mid-late August, which would allow the month of July for conciliation followed by the required 14 day-countdown period.\nIf there is a strike, how long will it last? There is no way to predict how long a strike would last. In the 47-year history of the DFA, there have been four strikes: 1985, 1988, 1998 and 2002. They ranged in length from one day (1985) to almost four weeks (2002). In the post-secondary sector in Canada, the average length of a strike is three weeks. It is important to note that DFA and the Board reached agreement in conciliation in 2012, 2017, 2020 and 2022.\nWhat activities would be interrupted? Job action (strike or lock-out) will interrupt specific activities including: in person classes, online classes, access to course materials, tests, grading, and communication with students on academic matters. These activities will all be interrupted.\n\n\nSenate will be suspended.\nSupervision of research students (both undergraduate and graduate) will be paused. Thesis defences, other presentations, and access to librarians will stop. There will be reduced access to some counseling services.\nInternships and practica might be disrupted depending on the specific details and supervisory responsibilities.\n\n\nThis will happen at all campuses.\nThe Administration may communicate to you additional programs and services that will be affected by job action. There will be physical pickets around campuses, so to get to the campus you may have to cross the picket line. Our faculty members will not prevent you from doing so. There will also be a significant social media presence, with posts and messaging related to the strike.\nHow can students keep their studies moving forward? In the event that a strike occurs this summer, many of you will not be in class. The best thing you can do is monitor the progress of the strike by checking our social media platforms and our website https://wearedal.ca If you are taking classes during the summer, we suggest that you treat the temporary cessation of classes like a “working study break” and continue reading, studying, learning, writing papers, etc. Many course instructors will provide specific examples of what to focus on prior to a strike. Because your workload may be more intense than normal after classes resume, stay current or ahead in your courses; at the end of a strike, faculty would try to work out a revised completion of courses that is fair and reasonable. Finally, although we cannot predict exactly how long a strike would last, we fully expect that you would have an opportunity to complete your courses. Both the DFA and the Dalhousie Administration have every motivation to make this possible."

    "text": "By Dave Westwood\nAfter a lengthy hiatus we are finally returning to formal negotiations at the table. The DFA’s Bargaining Team will resume conciliation with the Board’s Team Monday at 9:00 am, supported by our very capable conciliation officer Rick Rose. Conciliation will take place at the Future Inn on Fairfax Drive, just outside of the Bayer’s Lake commercial park. I will be present with our team, and I have blocked my calendar until midnight.\nI reached out to our Bargaining Team for some comments and perspectives as they head back to the table. Here is what they wanted to share with everyone:\nA Message from the DFA Bargaining Team\nDavid Wallbridge, Patti Doyle-Bedwell, Iona Green, Tim Juckes, Tom Koo, Joanne Mills, Julia M. Wright, Jack Brown, and Lynn Purves\n\nSome of you will have seen one or more of us at various pickets in Halifax and Truro over the last few weeks. It’s been great to walk and talk with all of you, but, well, we’d rather have been at the bargaining table working to get you a full and fair deal—and Monday we finally get to get back to that.\nWe know the headlines over the last few weeks have thrown us a few curve balls. In the context of our bargaining protocols, that September 2nd letter was like getting a limerick from a student when you asked for a research paper. But the people who have been doing that kind of thing aren’t on the Board’s bargaining team.\nThe two teams agreed to protocols at the beginning of this process and we were all following them at the table. Sure there were some abrupt moves, like asking for conciliation when we hadn’t even finished going through proposals. But we did make progress because we were talking and using the protocols, and our team is 100% ready to do that again on Monday.\nOf course it’s been a difficult few weeks. The lockout was unprecedented. The uncertainty has affected everyone in the DFA, our students, and even colleagues and communities beyond Dalhousie because of research and other collaborations. Huge thanks to the Job Action Committee, the DFA Executive, DFA staff, and every one of you for sharing your experiences and building solidarity: we hear you, and your resolve strengthens ours. Support from other unions has been amazing. And the province’s Conciliation Services has been tackling an unusual situation with impeccable professionalism to get everyone back to the table.\nMonday is not about looking back, but building a better future with an improved collective agreement. With the conciliator’s help, your bargaining team is ready to discuss both sides’ proposals, think creatively about solutions, and arrive at a negotiated deal so that we can all get back to where we really want to be—with our students and our colleagues on campus doing the jobs we love at the university we care about so much\nLike you, I hope that considerable progress can be made at Monday’s meeting but it might yet take some time to negotiate a satisfactory deal. We do not want the lockout to continue unnecessarily, but we are also committed to making sure that we bring back a deal that DFA Members will find acceptable. It is important that we all maintain our passion and commitment on the picket lines and in our online activities; our Bargaining Team needs your support now as ever.\nPlease keep a close eye on our official communications as we might need to call a full membership meeting with relatively short notice. We will coordinate with the Job Action Committee to facilitate maximal participation in any membership meetings. The Executive Committee will also be on standby so that we can be as nimble as possible with our decision-making processes.\nI hope you were able to join us on Friday past for what was a tremendous rally, featuring strong and unequivocal support from various student groups and leaders in addition to many inspiring remarks from DFA Members who have experienced – and continue to experience – precarity in their academic careers. We heard strong messages of support from our colleagues from CAUT and the CAUT Defence Fund, in addition to an invigorating performance by El Jones calling attention to the obvious but also subtle ways that powerful actors shape and influence public life and reminding us that there are times when people must stand together and fight for the things that matter.\nAt the conclusion of the rally we posted the list of 500+ signatories for the “Limited-Term Appointments” letter on the outer doors of the Henry Hicks Building – I was unable to get inside the building because the doors had been locked, and a message had been sent to those working inside the building to leave in anticipation of what might happen as a consequence of our rally. Judging by the mood and energy at the rally, I am confident that we are correct to be fighting to win improved job security for our precariously employed DFA colleagues.\nSincerely,\n\nDave Westwood\nDFA President 2025-2026"

    "text": "Dave Westwood, DFA President\nGood morning, everyone. Let me offer a quick update on two key decisions reached at this morning’s DFA Executive Committee meeting.\nThe Executive Committee agreed with the recommendation of the DFA Bargaining Team to reiterate our demand to the Board to return to the bargaining table immediately to resume negotiations. The following motion was approved (unanimous, with one abstention):\n“The Executive Committee recommends that the Bargaining Team returns to the bargaining table as soon as possible to discuss a revised Board offer with a fresh mandate that substantively addresses all the proposals in the DFA’s last package.” (M. Numer/D. Silvio) CARRIED\nAs a second order of business, the Executive Committee approved a motion to file a bargaining complaint with the Department of Labour based on the Board’s use of public messages to bargain directly with DFA Members and to circumvent bargaining at the table through appropriate channels. Further, the Board deliberately misrepresented their “offer” in their messaging, omitting the key detail that their proposal on interest arbitration required the DFA to abandon all unresolved proposals except wages. We will request that the Minister order the Board of Governors to return to the bargaining table and avoid further undermining the integrity of the collective bargaining process and delaying the resolution of the situation.\n“The Executive Committee approves the filing of a bargaining complaint with the Department of Labour against the Dalhousie Board of Governors.” (D. Silvio/R. Bejan) CARRIED\nThe Board continues to use a variety of tactics and strategies to attempt to conclude a new collective agreement without engaging with us at the bargaining table. They applied for conciliation after four bargaining sessions, and cancelled agreed dates for bargaining. They demanded the conciliation officer issue a ‘no board report’ at the earliest opportunity, despite failing to engage in meaningful negotiation at the table. They have left meetings early and failed to respond to DFA counterproposals on more than one occasion. They continue to use public messages to pressure DFA Members to accept their offer, and they have failed to disclose key details in those messages. Their “offer” to refer the issue of wages (and only wages, to be clear) to interest arbitration was not made at the table.\nBargaining at the table can happen very quickly, but it does require that the Board actually come to the table and negotiate. Initiating a lockout and then refusing to meet to negotiate is not only disrespectful to DFA Members, but creates a huge amount of uncertainty and stress while doing little to facilitate the conclusion of a new agreement that both sides find acceptable.\nWe are equal partners in this relationship, but the Board continues to act as though their needs, priorities, and timelines are more important than ours. I hope you will join me in raising your voice and telling the Board of Governors in no uncertain terms that deals are made at the table, and if they want to minimize further disruptions to the Fall Semester then they had better start joining us at the table.\nSincerely,\n\nDave Westwood\nDFA President 2025-2026"

    "text": "Dave Westwood DFA President 2025-2026\nI apologize that it has taken me this long to write to you to provide some perspective and comments about this auspicious time in our history as a union. I think it is fair to say things have been a bit hectic. We are only a few days into the lockout, but already much has happened with plenty more yet to come.\nAs you probably suspect, I receive a considerable number of messages from Members in addition to ‘external’ supporters, detractors, and genuinely curious individuals who are simply trying to understand what is happening. Many of these messages have helped shape and clarify my view of the situation, strengthening my own convictions in some areas, and forcing me to reconsider some things as well.\nI have served as DFA President several times, but this is my first lockout (and strike!) and I am ready and keen to learn and adapt, as we all must. I try to be open and responsive to any and all feedback anyone wants to provide, and I encourage you to share with me what is on your mind.\nOne of the most important lessons I have learned is to have grace, and not in the sense of smooth and effortless movement. As I understand it, to have grace is to appreciate and recognize that people are trying to do their best at this very difficult, stressful, and confusing time, and one cannot and should not expect perfection, composure, and freedom from mistakes. We all make mistakes, and it would be a further mistake to interpret this as evidence of malice or nefarious intent. We are all learning during this very difficult and stressful time, and I hope that everyone involved in this labour disruption can find the grace to allow ourselves and others the space to express our ideas and emotions with as little judgment as possible.\nThis is not easy for any of us. After all, we are humans, not chatbots.\n\nWhat comes next?\nThanks to our strong ‘rejection’ vote, our bargaining team now has a clear and strong mandate to demand that the Board return to the table to negotiate a contract that will bring a conclusion to the labour dispute.\nWe have formally notified the Board that we are ready and willing to meet them whenever they have a substantially improved offer for us to consider, or if they wish to meet to discuss more creative or innovative solutions to the issues that we have identified as our concerns and priorities. Our conciliation officer Rick Rose remains assigned to our file, and will continue to assist us in reaching a new agreement. Unfortunately, the Board is under no obligation to return to the table in a timely manner. Like you, I would hope that our employer will see the value and indeed necessity of moving quickly to resolve the labour disruption. Every minute that passes threatens the start and success of the Fall semester for our students, and of course for us and our fellow workers at Dalhousie.\nWe have no interest in a lengthy labour dispute – our goal all along has been to negotiate a contract that we believe DFA Members would find acceptable given the information shared with us during the development of our bargaining proposals. There is no intrinsic value in a long labour disruption. That said, we are very well prepared to support every Member even if the lockout continues for many weeks or even months. Let’s all hope that is not required.\nKey updates will be shared regularly as bargaining continues. Things could move quickly, or there could be long periods of waiting. We must keep our spirits and energy strong during this phase as the excitement from the first week of the lockout dissipates and we enter what could be an attritional period where things might turn into a bit of a grinding affair.\nI have already been amazed and astonished by the enthusiasm and energy that I’ve seen on our picket lines, and I know that we have a huge amount of creative energy and talent to pour into this job action so I look forward to the clever, funny, creative, and passionate messages on picket signs and flooding social media.\n\n\nRespecting and valuing diverse opinions and perspectives\nWe are all the DFA.\nWhile the term ‘President’ might conjure images of a hierarchical structure of command and control – perhaps more so now than ever – I am the DFA President in title only. We have almost 1000 Members and each of us is an equal part of this union. No two of us have exactly the same experiences, personal history, or perspective on all or even any of the issues related to the current labour disruption.\nNobody in our union reports to me, or is required to take direction from me, and nor do I intend or expect that any of you should follow my lead or adopt my views about anything. We are all academics who are perfectly capable of forming our own opinions through gathering and analyzing evidence and information. In addition to our robust analytical skills and abilities, we are also human beings who experience emotions and react in different ways in the face of challenge and adversity.\nI say this because there will be times during this labour dispute that you might disagree strongly with opinions or expressions of emotions that you see or hear from one or more colleagues in the DFA.\nIn addition, the University is a place where we form numerous relationships and bonds with DFA colleagues but also other workers including those who occupy the most senior administrative positions at the University including the President herself. A labour dispute is particularly challenging when you have integrated relationships with the individuals on the other side of the table.\nIf you disagree with someone’s comments or perspective, I encourage you to engage in a respectful dialogue with that person to share your experience and to learn about their experience which likely differs from your own.\n\n\nMy own self-reflections\nAs DFA President, I have a responsibility to provide leadership at this time, and with that comes the opportunity or even requirement to speak as “the voice of the DFA” to the extent that this is (a) required, and (b) possible.\nMy goal is to try to remain focused on moving us toward our ultimate goal, which is to conclude a new collective agreement that is the best one possible for all DFA Members. I am trying to be as open, honest, and transparent as I can, and I am doing my best to be the kind of leader that you can trust and respect. As I mentioned above, I make mistakes, and when I look back at things that I have done or said I am not always pleased or proud of my actions.\nI acknowledge and recognize that in some of my remarks to you and in the media, I allowed my own emotions to become a part of my communication, and that I may have unfairly criticized individuals in the senior administration and questioned their underlying motives. I recognize that senior administrators are humans who are also under a lot of stress and pressure and who also make mistakes, and that they have jobs to do just as we do.\nThat said, let me be perfectly clear with you on one point because it directly relates to some of the strong emotional reactions that I see in our membership, including myself.\nWe have been locked out of our place of work by President Kim Brooks, and President Kim Brooks alone.\nShe has the sole authority to initiate this action, and she did not have to do it. While I have no doubt that this choice was informed by consultation with a variety of individuals within the management apparatus, at the end of the day the decision rested with a single individual.\nIf you attended our inaugural rally, or have read the media coverage surrounding the lockout of DFA Members, you will have learned or been reminded that lockouts in any sector are uncommon, and in higher education they are almost unheard of. Lockouts forever change the relationship between employer and employees.\nIt is true that a lockout is a legal part of labour relations, in the same way that a strike is, but there is a very important and I would argue critical difference between the two that makes a lockout far more significant.\nUnionized employees that legally withdraw their labour during a strike do no direct personal harm to the employer. They are choosing to use one of the very few tools of power at their disposal to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment. When they initiate a strike, they do so with the recognition that they will surrender their own income for some period of time.\nIn contrast, employers that legally lock out their employees have chosen to do direct personal harm to those individuals by withholding the income that they depend upon to support themselves and their families.\nWhen President Kim Brooks locked us out, she did so with the knowledge that it would cause direct personal harm to each and every one of us, and it was a conscious and calculated choice to take this action “in the best interests of the institution”. It is entirely possible that anyone acting as President of Dalhousie University might have reached the same conclusion, but the fact is that it was a particular individual that took this action at a particular moment in time, and that person needs to own and be held accountable for that decision.\nSo, when I see and hear colleagues expressing strong emotions, I understand and recognize where this comes from.\nAll of this said, I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that personal or ad hominem attacks are appropriate, necessary, or helpful.\nSuch attacks are not and will not be a part of the DFA bargaining strategy.\nWe have been attacked, and hurt, but I believe the best way forward at this time is to continue generating pressure on the entire Board of Governors so that they bring an offer to the table that we can accept.\n\n\nWhat can we do at this time to reach a satisfactory conclusion?\nNow that we are into a labour disruption, I think it is imperative that we all do our best to support and encourage each other. If the dispute lasts a considerable length of time we will all begin to feel many forms of pressure, not the least of which is financial as essential expenses like groceries, rent, mortgage payments, and health needs come due. The strength of a union is the people in it, and we will need to lean on each other as pressure begins to mount. (NOTE: If you need to contact your financial institution to request a temporary relief of payments, click here for a template letter.)\nMuch of our media exposure to date has been ‘centrally controlled and managed’, and for good reason. We wanted to be sure that traditional media outlets were able to share accurate and timely information with key stakeholders such as students and their families. This helps to create pressure on the Board, as students begin to recognize that significant disruptions are about to occur to their plans for education at Dalhousie. You can help us to amplify this pressure through your own personal channels including social media. The kinds of messages that create maximum pressure on the Board are those that create awareness amongst students and their families that the longer this dispute drags on, the greater the impact on their academic year in terms of when it might start, when it might end, and what amount of content might be lost if the term needs to be cut short because of a protracted labour dispute. When discussing the issues at stake in our collective bargaining, I encourage all DFA Members to speak openly and honestly about your own personal context. The issues that we are fighting for resonate with our fellow workers: catching wages up to high levels of inflation and cost of living, protecting good quality jobs for future generations, helping new workers to cope with the disproportionate impact of the wage/cost-of-living gap, fighting against the precarity of work that has seen an abuse of contract-based employment that allows employers to make employees disposable even though the work that is required is essential and continuing. For many of us, myself included, the fight at this time is for others in the who are facing more difficult circumstances. I have heard loud and clear that those most in need of our collective strength at this time are our early-career colleagues, and our colleagues that are being exploited through continued precarious contracts.\n\n\nFinal remarks\nA labour disruption is a time to come together, and it can be a great time to organize and build collective power for the future. There is a unique energy and excitement during a labour disruption, and we get to interact and mingle with our fellow union members in ways that just do not happen at any other time. I encourage everyone to make the most of this rare moment to build solidarity, and to talk about and take note of ways that we can build on our newfound strength after this dispute is resolved. Once we settle into a routine with our picket lines and activities, I would love to see spontaneous events, gatherings, and social activities that help us to forge strong and lasting bonds with each other. There is strength in a union, and that strength is us.\nSincerely,\n\nDave Westwood\nDFA President 2025-2026"

    "section": "",
    "text": "(September 11, 2025 - Halifax, NS): Dalhousie President Kim Brooks has asked that the DFA share the Board of Governors’ latest offer with the DFA membership.  The offer was shared via email with members late Wednesday evening.\n“The Board continues to bargain in public. While this latest offer was not made through the proper channels, and did not reflect the full breadth of discussions that had taken place between the two sides, we nevertheless decided to share it with our members,” says Dave Westwood, DFA President. “We also shared the DFA proposal to show how much progress was actually being made during conciliation earlier this week. We have invited the Board to continue those productive discussions this morning at 9:00 but have not received any response. I have to seriously question their statements about wanting to end the lockout because that requires continuing negotiations, not presenting yet another ultimatum.”\nDFA will hold two meetings with its membership today to provide a full update on the bargaining process to date.\n“The Board has created a huge mess by choosing a lockout when they did, and they continue to act as though there is no problem, or that it is somehow the union’s fault that they have acted irrationally and ignored all the advice we have offered them,” notes Westwood. “They continue to misrepresent their financial situation, and have certainly not acknowledged the $8-10M saved while not paying 1000 faculty during the lockout.”\nThe DFA also tabled a proposal detailing what must happen for faculty members to return to work once an agreement is reached. At least ten days of preparation for fall term have been lost and the start of term is still uncertain. “Even when we eventually ratify a new collective agreement, members have lost mandatory preparation time and will need at least 10 days to get classes and laboratories ready for the Fall term.”\nThe Board has yet to present a plan on how to solve this problem, and any return-to-work arrangements must be ratified by DFA Members before the lockout will end.\nThe Dalhousie Board of Governors locked out 1000 professors, instructors, librarians and counsellors. DFA is recognized as the sole bargaining agent for its members.\n\nAbout DFA\nThe DFA is the certified bargaining agent for almost 1,000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors at Dalhousie University. As a volunteer-based organization, we advocate for the rights of our members and work to protect and advance the academic integrity of the University.\nTo arrange an interview with DFA President David Westwood: email DFA Communications Officer Catherine.Wall@dal.ca"

    "title": "Two-Week Countdown Begins to Possible Legal Job Action at Dalhousie",
    "section": "",
    "text": "(Tuesday, July 29, 2025 – Halifax, NS) – Conciliation Officer Rick Rose has filed his “no board report” with the Minister of Labour, indicating a bargaining impasse and triggering a 14-day countdown before legal job action can take place between Dalhousie Board of Governors and Dalhousie Faculty Association. “Our union has no intention of initiating a strike in August,” says DFA President David Westwood. “If there is any labour disruption before the start of the fall semester, it will have been because Dalhousie’s Board of Governors chose to lock out our professors, instructors, professional counsellors and librarians.”\nNow that the conciliator has filed his report, a 14-day countdown begins before either side could initiate labour action, subject to providing a minimum of 48 hours’ notice. “I reached out to Dalhousie President Kim Brooks yesterday requesting a face-to-face conversation to ensure that the administration is fully aware of the serious consequences of a lockout leading into the fall semester. At this point the question is ‘What will it take to reach an agreement?’,” notes Westwood. “We are prepared to negotiate, and I hope that the Board understands that they will need to improve their offer to get a deal done. While I hope that the Board does not intend to actually lock out our members, their posturing so far has suggested that they wanted to be in precisely this position at this point in time.”\nThe two sides are scheduled for one last-minute conciliation session on August 11. If no tentative agreement is reached, the Board could lockout all members of the faculty association on August 12. This includes almost 1000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors. The current agreement between DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors expired June 30, 2025. Negotiations began the last week of May, and after only four bargaining meetings, the Board of Governors filed for conciliation on June 2. One more bargaining meeting was held June 20, and then Rick Rose was appointed as the conciliation officer on June 23, 2025. Conciliation meetings were held July 9, 15 and 16, 2025. The Board walked away from conciliation prematurely. Earlier this month, 85.5% of the DFA membership participated in a strike vote. Of those, an overwhelming 91.2% voted in favour of going on strike if an acceptable deal cannot be reached.\nThere are many outstanding issues on the table that have yet to be agreed. They include: wages that account for cost-of-living increases and are on par with the pattern in the sector, preventing full-time jobs from becoming precarious sessional contracts; ending the practice of using limited-term contracts for continuing teaching needs; expanding access to childcare and ensuring workloads are fair and reasonable.\nDFA’s Bargaining Bulletins can be found here.\n\nAbout DFA\nThe DFA is the certified bargaining agent for almost 1,000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors at Dalhousie University.

Our first installment, about our struggle and the fight for a public university–written by\nNancy Ross and Luc S. Cousineau–has just been published by the Canadian Centre for Policy alternatives.  Please read full the piece, but this passage seems on point for our bulletin:\n\nOur students need the tools to recognize and resist social injustices, which are too frequently the result of policies shaped by neoliberal ideologies that have little regard for environmental devastation and for the vulnerable in our society. The DFA’s strike mandate can be seen as strong resistance to right-wing neoliberal tendencies that strangle universities. \n\n\n\nDSU Actions\n\nWe’d like to let you know about two events from our colleagues in the DSU!\n\nThe first, taking place today, is one we mentioned in yesterday’s  bulletin: a “Lectures from the Line Teach-In,” a co-sponsored solidarity event between the Dalhousie Student Union and our own union. This event will take place on the quad in front of Hicks from 12:00 - 1:00 p.m. The program is as follows:\n\nOpening Remarks: Maren Mealey, President, Dalhousie Student Union\nIntroductions/MC: Kiran Banerjee, Department of Political Science\n\nSpeakers:\n\nKassandra Luciuk, Department of History: “Key Moments in Canadian Labour History”\nChristopher Bennett, Faculty of Management & College of Sustainability: “Trust, Corporatization, and Seeds”\nHannah Harrison, Marine Affairs Program: “How Does Nova Scotia get to the Coast?”\nAjay Parasram, Department of International Development Studies: “Revolutionary Politics of Student Movements” \n\nSecond, the DSU is holding a rally, Wednesday, Sept. 10th, at noon, in support of tuition refunds. The students will be meeting at the Dalhousie sign on Robie and University, and march up to the Hicks Building. We encourage all those available to consider attending, to support the students as they have supported us!\n\n\n\nSolidarity Run/Walk\n\nOur colleagues Jen Gauthier, Hannah Rosborough, and Tony Walker would like to extend the following invitation to members who may be interested!\n5KM Solidarity Run/Walk Invitation!\nWhen: Wednesday, September 10 at 9:00 AM.\nWhere: Meet at the front entrance of the SUB. The route will pass all picket lines. \nPace: All paces welcome!\nNote: If you plan to participate during your regular picket shift you must notify your picket captain of this Job Action Committee approved activity. If you are scheduled for a 7:30 start, please join your regular picket before the run. If you are scheduled for the 9:15 to 11:15 shift, please join your regular picket after the run.

In 2012 I was wandering around campus preparing my application for tenure and promotion and I wondered, “why do I do this?” I was so stressed. I was sending out articles for peer review, finishing my teaching dossier, preparing my application for tenure and promotion, which is typically due on the 15th of September. I came to campus and classes were just starting, and I could feel the energy and the buzz of having students milling about campus in the Student Union building and all over campus. I felt uplifted, I felt energized. I realized that day, “this is why I do it.” Students come back every year and give me the tonic, then remind me what it feels to help shape learning, help guide students through their academic journeys, see them succeed, and then have them come back and tell us “oh, I used what you taught us in the classroom.” This is what the first week of September always means to me.\n\n\n\nReminder from the JAC\n\nRegarding “one-off” picket shift changes or accommodations (e.g. for appointments, sick days, etc.): email your picket captain and copy scheduling.dfastrike2025@gmail.com so that the proper changes can be made on our system."

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\n\nPresident’s Response\nFor those of you who have not seen President Dave Westwood’s response to the latest misleading missive from Grace Jefferies-Aldridge, VP People and Culture, it is linked here (pdf) and posted below. [Ed. note: I’m honestly too frustrated by senior admin actions–or utter lack thereof, in President Kim Brooks’ case–to add any commentary].\n\nDear DFA Member,\n \nEarlier this afternoon the Board released another inappropriate and misleading message to the campus community, almost identical in kind to the interest arbitration communication that led us to file a bargaining complaint with the Minister of Labour. The DFA Executive Committee will be asked tomorrow to approve adding this latest incident to the substance of our earlier complaint.\n \nOn September 2, Grace Aldridge-Jefferies, Dalhousie Vice-President of People and Culture, sent me a letter with what she characterized as an ‘offer’ – this is the ‘offer’ referred to in the campus-wide communication this afternoon. Ms. Aldridge-Jefferies is not a member of the Board’s bargaining team, and I am not a member of the DFA’s bargaining team. Communications of this kind violate the bargaining protocols jointly agreed by the DFA and Board. We called an urgent meeting of the DFA Bargaining Team, and also contacted our conciliation officer; all bargaining proposals are to be exchanged at the bargaining table with both parties present.\n \nIn the evening on September 3, our conciliation officer Rick Rose emailed the DFA and Board. The key recommendation from the email is extracted here:\n \n“As a way forward, I am setting a meeting date to resume conciliation talks for Monday, September 8th, 2025 at 9:00 am. My office considered other dates - both earlier and later – but I feel this date will give us our best chance of having positive conversations and outcome.”\n \nThe DFA Bargaining Team met again this afternoon, and agreed that the only way to conclude a new collective agreement is at the bargaining table under the supervision of a conciliation officer. We can no longer trust the Board’s bargaining team to act in good faith. We trust Rick Rose’s judgement that the best time to meet is on Monday.\n \nTo be clear, we have accepted the invitation to conciliation on Monday, September 8, and we will not engage with any member of the Board until that time. The Board is free to introduce the ‘offer’ sent by Ms. Aldridge-Jefferies as a formal bargaining proposal following agreed protocol on Monday.\n \nI appreciate that you are anxious to receive updates about progress in our negotiations, and ask for your trust that we are working in the best interest of all Members. We are dealing with an unprofessional and unpredictable bargaining partner trying to undermine the collective bargaining process to sow division and confusion. I encourage you to wait for communications from us before taking the Board’s messages about bargaining at face value.\n \nIt is your work on the line and elsewhere that brought us back to conciliation. Our efforts are having an impact, and we will go into the meeting Monday with the goal of reaching agreement.\n \nI look forward to seeing you all at our rally tomorrow at noon.\n \nDave Westwood\nDFA President 2025-2026\n\n\nReminder: on Friday, Sept 5th at 12:00 p.m., DFA members, CAUT flying pickets, other allies, community members, and students will be standing together outside the Killam Library to support precarious workers in our union! Please attend and tell your friends!\n\nNote for 11:00 a.m. picketers: Picket Captains and their teams on the 11:00-1:00 shift should head towards the Killam with sufficient time to get there by 12:00. Please connect with your captains to assist bringing your materials to the rally. There will be stations with signs indicating different lines “Coburg,” “University,” etc. to bring the material to.\n\nNote for 12:45 picketers: if possible, please come to the rally to pick up your material, and then walk to your shifts as the rally ends. We recognize the shift might start late.\n\n\n\nHumans of Dalhousie: Dr. Andrew Brown (English) and Dr. LiLil Johnson (English and Gender and Women’s Studies)\n\n\n\nWe are both DFA faculty members in the English Department and we just had our first baby this March. In addition to many of the issues that have been discussed publicly, what is especially disappointing is the Board’s unwillingness to negotiate on non-monetary or relatively low-cost issues that would support DFA families like us. The Board outright rejected considerations such as expanding their parental leave provisions, offering space at the Dal daycare for children of faculty, or implementing policies that ensure that the classes we teach are scheduled at different times. They conveniently left out that their most recent offer included dropping these important issues. \n\nThis contract and being a faculty member at Dal is not just about money. (Though many of our faculty, especially junior and non-tenure stream faculty, are indeed underpaid compared to other universities across both Canada and the US.) We love doing our research, teaching, and service at Dal and chose to start our family here because of the supports for families for which the DFA has advocated. We encourage the Board to come to the table and continue to be a leader in supporting academics and their families!\n\nFun fact: We met through organizing for our graduate student union, Local 33!\n\n\n\nVirtual Picket: Photo Request\nOur virtual team asks that people share photos of picket lines and rallies by emailing them to picket.photos.dfa@gmail.com!\n\n\n\nNews from The Line\nColleague Steve Parcell sends us the following: \n\nOne of my fellow picketers from the first two weeks suggested that I send you this item for the daily bulletin. It’s one of the daily amusements I sent to the 11–1 South Street crew, led by rockstar Drew Weatherhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Street crew\nAfter seven days, here are some stats on walking.\n\nOur loop is 150 metres:\n \nEach day of picketing includes\n\n30 loops per hour\n2 hours per shift\n25 persons\n\nOur collective distance each day is: \n\n150 x 30 x 2 x 25 = 225,000 metres = 225 kilometres\n\nThat’s the distance to Sackville, New Brunswick.\n \nAfter seven days of picketing:\n\nour collective distance is 1575 kilometres\n\nThat’s the distance to Kingston.\n\nCollectively, do we have a super power?\n\nDistance: 1575 km\nTime: 14 hours\nSpeed: 1575/14 = 112.5 km/hour\nUsain Bolt’s top speed: 37.58 km/hour\n\nTherefore, are we three times faster than Usain Bolt\n(or would statisticians poke a hole in this calculation)?"

Over 1000 members, across multiple campuses (and provinces–we see you NB colleagues!) organized themselves across more than two dozen picket lines, three separate HQs, and in virtual duties (see the update from colleagues Asha Jeffers and Martha Radice!).\nAnd while preparations had been ongoing beforehand, we should remember that all of you put all of that into action on two days’ notice after President Brooks made her incomprehensible decision to lock us out while we were voting on the Board’s offer.\nIn these two weeks, we’ve shown by our organization and action that we make Dalhousie work. What has the administration and board done in that time? They’ve refused to talk, and until the last moment they refused to tell students the truth about the effects their lockout would have on term. In other words, they seem to have done everything in their power to show they have no idea what it takes to lead an institution. \nAs Nadine Ezzeddine makes clear in her devastating video below, their actions are also damaging our students and our entire province.\nHow long can President Brooks and her team continue their campaign to undermine Dalhousie’s operations, its reputation, and our students’ education? Why have they continued to do so this long?\n\nMaybe when–not if–they come back to the table, we can teach them how to #KeepDalStrong, if they’re willing to learn.\n\n\n“When nurses are silenced, patients suffer.”\n\n\n\n\nVirtual pickets are on line\n\nVirtual picket captains met on Friday to brainstorm their teams’ duties.

Our human, San Patten, adopted us and we have the glorious security of knowing we won’t be sent back to the shelter, the mean streets of Texas, or the woods of Hammonds Plains. It is wonderful to have a permanent home where we are valued and recognized for the fabulous pets that we are. Sadly, our human has been living with insecure employment for 10 human years (that’s 80 dog years!). She’s had three 3-year contracts, plus a 1-year “exemption” contract, teaching as a 0.5FTE LTA instructor in the College of Sustainability. She was brought in to contribute a human health, social justice and non-profit sector perspective to the Environment, Society and Sustainability program. If our human had job stability, she would reliably bring home yummy treats without anxiously wondering if her contract would be renewed yet again. We wonder: if our human is qualified enough to teach for ten years, why doesn’t Dalhousie University recognize her contributions with a permanent position? Maybe it’s because Dal wants the option of sending her away at the stroke of an eliminated budget line and are afraid to permanently commit to her as a valuable member of the faculty. We have more security than she does, and that’s just wrong!\n\n[Ed. note: The letter of support for our colleagues on limited-term appointments is still accepting signatures.\n\nRead the linked letter\nClick at the top to offer your support by signing the letter.]\n\n\n\n\nShout Outs!\n\nA bit of a backlog of shout-outs from the last few weeks (if I’ve missed any, remind me!):\n\nDrew Weatherhead on the last week’s South Street/Dalplex line: she was the picket captain on the noon hour shift.

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\nDFA Files Bargaining Complaint against the Board. The Board Replies with the Same Misinformation\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like just yesterday morning that we hadn’t heard anything new from the Board of Governors or President Brooks in over a week. Then, briefly, it seemed like we had! But, then it became clear what we heard was the same ol’ same ol’. Another round of “meet the new tactic, same as the old tactic.”\n\nTo get a full summary of the Board’s … “activities” yesterday, please read Dave Westwood’s President’s message. For a pithier version, though, I’d like to direct you to the video above that Dave did with some of the Job Action team. Thrown together in a hallway with a phone propped up on a box of granola bars, this 2 minute video explains 2 weeks of labour action, and just how egregious the board’s behaviour has been.\n\nToday, the Executive Committee of the DFA reiterated its commitment to full and fair bargaining, demanding the Board of Governors return to the table. To be clear: The Board did not put a new offer on the table. Instead, they pulled yet another publicity stunt.\n\nAnd so the executive of the DFA decided enough is enough. The Board cannot continue to pretend in public that it’s bargaining while doing nothing of the sort in reality, and so the executive approved an official bargaining complaint with the Department of Labour, which is now filed. As Dave puts it, this complaint is\n\n“based on the Board’s use of public messages to bargain directly with DFA Members and to circumvent bargaining at the table through appropriate channels. Further, the Board deliberately misrepresented their “offer” in their messaging, omitting the key detail that their proposal on interest arbitration required the DFA to abandon all unresolved proposals except wages.”\n\nThe university’s response? To do the exact same thing! In her message of August 28th, Vice-President Grace Jefferies writes, “the DFA requested a return to the bargaining table with a refreshed financial mandate.” \n\nNO! We requested that the Board return “to the bargaining table as soon as possible to discuss a revised Board offer with a fresh mandate that substantively addresses all the proposals in the DFA’s last package.”\n\nIt is past time for the Board to stop playing games and start bargaining.”The need to negotiate, not dictate.”\n\n\n\nNew Schedules are Coming Soon!\nSome notes from our amazing team of schedulers, who have done a tonne of work, and deserve the thanks of the entire membership for these efforts!\n\nSchedules have changed\nA lot of people will have moved shifts and even roles. We understand that it can be hard to start a new routine and say goodbye to a group you have already learned to appreciate. Please take this as an opportunity for new friendships and feel free to visit the Care Hub.\n\n\nSpecial circumstances are accommodated as best as possible\nAn incredible 305 of you responded to the survey with some circumstances that make our current job action a challenge. Rest assured that we have done our best to find shifts and roles that suit your needs. \n\n\nJoint scheduling\nA lot of you have requested to be scheduled with someone else. Because of the high volume (over 100 requests) we were only able to grant joint scheduling to those of you who mutually mentioned one another on the survey and who selected compatible locations and times. If you’re participating in person, we hope that you will get to catch up with others during general actions. If you are not assigned with a preferred partner, please feel free to go to one of our headquarter locations with your partner to see if you can change shifts.\n\n\n\n\nRally and “Chalk and Talk” (or “Chalk and Walk”!)\nPlease revisit yesterday’s newsletter for a full description of tomorrow’s outreach campaign, the “Chalk and Talk” or “Chalk and Walk,” depending on who you talk to (or walk with), and a reminder of our noon rally in front of the Killam library! Robin Whitaker, the President of CAUT (and Atlantic university colleague from MUN) will be joining us in solidarity, and flying picketers will be joining us from across the country! We’d like a strong turnout to welcome this solidarity, and we can’t wait to see our Truro colleagues here in Halifax!\n\nLast but not least, we will be handing out “freezies” to students as a treat on a hot day, and to remind them that term isn’t “frozen” because of us, but because of the Board’s behaviour. (Seriously, the Board needs to “Let it Go,” thaw relations, and come back to the table…)\n\nThe rally will be broadcast via Facebook at the “@dalfacultyassoc” account.\n\n\nLetter Campaigns\n\nI Stand with the DFA: With the help of our colleagues in CAUT, we are now running a letter-writing campaign, “I Stand with the Dalhousie Faculty Association.” If you follow this link, you will be taken to a page that will generate a form letter (which can be personalized), and when you click “Add Your Voice,” the letter will be emailed directly to: \n\nDr. Kim Brooks, President - president@dal.ca\nDr. Wanda Costen, Provost and Vice-President Academic - provost@dal.ca\nGrace Jefferies, Vice-President People and Culture - gjefferi@dal.ca\nDr. Rick Ezekiel, Vice-Provost, Student Affairs - rick.ezekiel@dal.ca\nCheryl Fraser, Chair, Board of Governors - cheryl.macdonald@dal.ca\n\nPlease feel free to share with any supporters!\n\nLTA Letter: A reminder\n\nread the linked letter \nthen click at the top to offer your support by signing the letter.\n\n\n(Pictured: Kassandra Luciuk (l.) from JAC and Christine Saulnier (r.), the Director of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives-Nova Scotia, who stopped by our Solidarity Hub.

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Week of Silence, a Week of Solidarity\nOne week ago today, on Wednesday, August 20th, at 9:30 a.m., Dalhousie entered the history books. We thought we’d do a recap of the past seven days, and we noticed a Tale of Two Dalhousies:\nFor the Board and Administration this was a week of silence and isolation:\n\nDalhousie became the first U15 university in Canada to lock out faculty.\nDalhousie President Kim Brooks became the first president, that we’ve found, to lock faculty out while they were in the middle of voting on the university’s offer. This may, in fact, be a first in Canadian labour history?\nIt has also been a week of complete silence:\n\nSilence from the President on the effects her decisions will and have had on students, their families, and the community.\nSilence from the Board’s negotiating team. We are ready and willing to do the difficult and necessary work of bargaining. They seem unwilling to work toward a solution.\n\nAll of these decisions are isolating Dalhousie’s “leaders” from the very staff and students that make our university work, and from our local, provincial, national, and international partners.\n\nBut for the DFA this has been a week of loud solidarity as we fight to #KeepDalStrong!\n\nWe held our first labour rally in 23 years, attended by members and in solidarity with staff colleagues, students, sibling labour unions, and community members.\nWe were loud in our determination to get back to the bargaining table and back to work.\nWe’ve made strong statements in the media and on social media, including about our concern for students.\nAnd of course, we’ve been loud in the streets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicket Line Updates\nFrom our Job Action HQ:\nIMPORTANT NOTE: On Labour Day (Monday, September 1), picket lines will not operate and alternate duties will not be conducted. Please be reminded that DFA Members receive strike pay for 7 days a week, including weekends and holidays.\nThe Job Action Committee is hard at work creating new schedules for September, and assigning strike duties that best suit each Member, while also making sure we have enough Members at each picket line and across different job action duties. Please bear with us as we are trying our best to balance these imperatives; we greatly appreciate your patience and understanding. As with August, most duties will be carried out Monday - Friday, 7:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m., though there may be additional work required on evenings and weekends for some tasks. While most Members will be assigned picket line duties, alternative and/or virtual strike duties will be made available for those Members who are unable to participate in picketing.\nPlease note that children, other family members, staff colleagues, and anyone interested is always welcome to join us on the picket lines.\nDFA members will be expected to complete lockout/strike duties in order to qualify for strike pay.\nIf you require additional information on strike duties not available in the FAQ, please email 2025.strike.dfa@gmail.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Roundup\nPresident Brooks’ unprecedented lockout and the uncertainty it is creating (one is tempted to say threat it is posing…) to the Fall term have gained significant press coverage in the past week. We wanted to do a partial round-up in case you have been too busy on the line to catch them. Special thanks to our wonderful Communications Officer Catherine Wall for all of her work with the Press, to our many members who have done interviews, and to the students for being so honest about the terrible position the president’s lockout is putting them in.\n(Our editors apologize for the lack of fancy design, basic details, or any logical organizing principles to this list. Take it as sarcastic commentary on the lack of design, basic details, or logical organizing principles in the Board’s behaviour.)\n\nHalifax Examiner \nCBC\nRadio-Canada\nGlobal\nCTV\nCBC\nCanadian Press\nSaltwire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating Librarians\nAs these bulletins continue, we want to acknowledge the specialized work many of our colleagues are bringing to our job action. Yesterday, we highlighted the work counsellors are doing in the Solidarity Hub, and today we’d like to acknowledge the amazing efforts of our librarian members, brought to our attention by their colleagues!\n\nDominic Silvio, DFA President-Elect and Past President, and rally leader extraordinaire\nJulie Marcoux, survey developer, scheduling, data wizard \nShelley McKibbon, strike headquarters coordinator (Halifax)\nErin MacPherson, strike headquarters coordinator (Truro)\nJackie Phinney, communications drafts (Saint John)\nRobin Parker and Melissa Rothfus, drafting instructions for data entry\nand so many more than we have space for here, walking the lines, working on virtual and alt-duties and so much more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShout Outs\nWe received so many replies to our Call for Shout Outs that we’ll have to consider making this a running series!  Here are just a few!\n\nNadine Ezzeddine and Michel Ladouceur, picket captains for Oxford 12:45 [ed. note: and member and chair, respectively, of our Membership Engagement committee!], for encouraging singing, dancing, and high-energy picketing (and having a loud speaker to play our music!!) **Honk honk**!!!\nLaura deGelleke (Oceanography): She brings nonstop, infectious energy to the line: shouting our message to cars, handing out high fives, making tons of noise, and always smiling.\nRina Wehbe (Computer Science; pictured): living her best life on the picket line!\n\nDon’t forget to send us more!

Have an idea for something to cover? Let us know at dfa.daily.bulletin@gmail.com.\n\n\nAugust 22nd Rally!\nThe last time our union held a job action rally was twenty-three years ago, but we haven’t lost our touch! This past Friday over 300 people (members and supporters, including students, representatives from other Dalhousie unions, other local, provincial, and national unions, and community members) gathered outside the Killam Library to make our voices heard! And make them heard we did! As President Dave Westwood said in his recent message, “our bargaining team now has a clear and strong mandate to demand that the Board return to the table to negotiate a contract.”\n\n\n\nPicket News and New Schedules!\nIt looks like rain is coming, which is good news for the province! But keep an eye on the weather and dress appropriately for the lines (there are a limited number of ponchos available).\n\nYou should have all received an email over the weekend with a new survey asking for your availability for pickets in September. Make sure to ask colleagues on your line if they received theirs, so we can catch anyone whose survey went to their junk folder, or had other technical glitches. Find someone who didn’t get it? Just forward the email to them! Thank you!\n\n\nSolidarity and Support\nMore than two dozen academic and public sector unions from across the entire country have donated to our cause, for a growing total of over $35,000! We’ve also received important support from other unions, including the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour and theNova Scotia Teachers Union, among many others. We’ll keep updating the list available here so you can all see the wealth of support for our cause! We also received organizing and other supports from CAUT and our sibling Dalhousie unions of NSGEU and CUPE 3912, who issued statements and were represented at our rally. Solidarity is how we will all win fair contracts!\n\n\n\nBargaining Update\nWith our overwhelming rejection of the Board’s entirely underwhelming offer, we have sent the ball back to their court. As of this writing (Sunday night, Aug 24), there has been no update from the Board. In fact, there has been no communication from administration since President Kim Brooks locked us out on Wednesday! Hopefully we hear from their team soon that they are coming back to the table. Until then, maybe we should start a new game show: “Where in the World is President Brooks?!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\nWe are planning some great activities and supports for our members. Some of our counsellor colleagues will be setting up in the Solidarity Hub at the Student Union Building: stay tuned for more details, but feel free to stop by the Hub for a snack and a chat! And don’t forget, we’ll be holding rallies every Friday: let’s see if we can break our attendance record from last week! Time and location to follow."

    "title": "Locked Out Together: The Importance of Solidarity Between Dalhousie Students and Faculty",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On August 20, 2025, President Brooks and her senior administration made the unprecedented decision to lock out almost 1,000 members of the Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA). Unlike a strike, in which the choice to stop work is made collectively and democratically, a lockout is initiated by the administration. During a lockout, members of the DFA are prevented from completing their academic duties. The result was classes cancelled, thesis defences postponed, and tens of thousands of students left without mentorship or answers. Rather than bargaining in good faith or allowing a legal strike, the administration shut down its own classrooms.\nThe Dalhousie Student Union(DSU) council, which represents more than 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students, recognized the importance of the work we do as faculty members, librarians, and counsellors by voting to affirm its support for locked-out DFA members. The DSU has declared unequivocally that “the strength of the university community depends on the well-being of both students and faculty.” This public display of solidarity reflects a growing recognition that students and faculty are not on opposite sides of this dispute, but rather, they are both being failed by Dalhousie’s leadership.\nWhile tuition continues to be collected, with many students paying over $10,000 per term, the university has suspended the very services those fees were supposed to guarantee. Although this situation affects all of us, international students endure further anxiety from adjusting to a new country, paying significantly higher tuition fees, and now face unnecessary academic and visa uncertainty. Students are paying for an education they cannot access, while faculty are barred from providing it. Whatever the administration’s rationale, the lockout cannot be defended against the reality of declining enrolments, rising tuition, and the reputational damage of alienating both students and faculty.\nBoth students and faculty want education, in which teaching and mentorship are valued, to be a priority for the institution. The DSU rightly acknowledges that faculty working conditions are student learning conditions, which in practice means:\n\nSmaller class sizes and individualized feedback\nAccessible office hours and thesis supervision\nResearch opportunities and academic mentorship\nStability and continuity in academic programs\n\nWhen professors are respected and resourced to teach, mentor, and research, students thrive. When faculty are silenced or sidelined for the sake of bottom lines, education suffers, and students are left behind.\nStudents have refused to be silent. Many have joined faculty on the picket lines, emailed the administration, and organized their own solidarity efforts. As one Dalhousie student put it, “I just want to learn,” a plea that reflects the exasperation of many who suddenly find themselves without classes, guidance, or certainty. Another echoed this sense of disillusionment: “We’ve paid tuition. We’ve arranged our lives around our classes—and now, nothing.” These voices underscore how the lockout has left students paying for an education they cannot access, with their academic plans and personal lives thrown into limbo (CBC News, qtd. in Yahoo News).\nThe university administration continues to frame the lockout as regrettable but necessary. Unfortunately, instead of sharing real dialogue with the DFA, the administration has chosen silence to its members and public relations messaging, including bargaining in public, to pressure us into submission. This choice undermines trust and weakens their credibility. However, the path forward requires that collective bargaining is respected with due process, and the DFA has repeatedly stated its commitment to returning to the table. As Nova Scotia’s largest post-secondary institution, students, families, and taxpayers should expect that Dalhousie’s administrative team lead with integrity by ending the lockout and returning to the bargaining table.\nEven as bargaining resumes, the lesson of this lockout is clear: students and faculty are strongest when we stand together. The show of solidarity across picket lines and classrooms has made it impossible to ignore that our futures are intertwined. We were locked out together, and together we must continue working for a university that values learning, mentorship, and the public good."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the faculty lockout at Dalhousie University continues, its consequences are beginning to crystallize in ways that go far beyond the picket lines. With major federal grant deadlines looming, the university’s unwillingness to support its researchers and students and its persistence in keeping faculty locked out is putting millions of dollars in funding at serious risk. This funding, along with training students and new researchers, is essential to maintaining the future of Dalhousie’s research ecosystem.\nThis week should have been a final push for researchers to submit applications for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grants, two of the most significant funding opportunities in the Canadian academic calendar. But due to the lockout, faculty members were denied access to their applications effectively cutting two weeks from their preparation time. Worse still, they were told that if they missed the internal deadline, their applications would not be forwarded to the funder at all.\nThis lockout-caused bottleneck has real financial consequences. In the CIHR Fall 2024 competition alone, Dalhousie researchers secured $3.35 million in funding across four projects. In previous years, the numbers were even higher: $8.1 million in 2023 and $5.8 million in 2021. If this year’s applications are weakened or blocked entirely due to the lockout, Dalhousie could lose millions in research funding. These funds support postdocs, students, research staff, lab personnel, and many research overhead costs.\nThe situation is equally dire for SSHRC Insight Grants. According to internal estimates, the lockout could result in a loss of $1.23 million in SSHRC funding based on the five-year median grant capture. These grants are not just financial lifelines for faculty research, they also provide up to six years of support for research and publication, and they contribute directly to Dalhousie’s reputation as a U15, research-intensive university.\nDoctoral students are also caught in the crossfire. The internal deadline for SSHRC’s new CGRS-D doctoral fellowship competition is October 6, and each award is worth $120,000 over three years. Based on past success rates, Dalhousie could expect around 13 students to win these fellowships, totaling $1.56 million in student funding. But with faculty locked out and unable to help students prepare applications or submit reference letters, those chances are rapidly diminishing.\nThe long-term impact? Top students may choose to pursue their doctorates elsewhere, taking their talent, and funding, with them.\n\n\nThe lockout is also affecting SSHRC Partnership Grants, which rely on collaboration between institutions. Reports suggest that Dalhousie partners are being removed from applications because they cannot access the university’s Office of Research Services (ORS) system. This not only undermines current proposals but could damage Dalhousie’s reputation as a reliable research partner in future collaborations.\nThe numbers speak volumes. CIHR projects currently funded at Dalhousie include cutting-edge research in neuroscience, cancer therapy, Indigenous health, and AI-based mental health monitoring. These projects range from $141,000 to over $1.1 million each, and many involve multi-year, multi-investigator teams. Losing even a fraction of this funding would be a blow to Dalhousie’s research capacity and its ability to attract and retain top scholars.\nStudent scholarships are also at risk. In 2025, CIHR doctoral scholarships awarded to Dalhousie students totaled $389,997 across three recipients. These awards are critical for supporting graduate education and ensuring that students can focus on their research without financial hardship.\nWhat’s most troubling is that these losses are not hypothetical.\nThey are happening.\nThe deadlines are this week. The lockout has already disrupted workflows, blocked access to systems, and created uncertainty that undermines the confidence of researchers and students alike.\nBeyond the immediate financial impact, the lockout threatens Dalhousie’s long-term standing in the national research landscape. Funding success is cumulative: strong applications lead to strong projects, which lead to publications, partnerships, and future grants. Interrupting this cycle will have ripple effects that last for years and those ripples will be in the shape of Dalhousie administration.\nDalhousie has long prided itself on being a leader in research and innovation. But leadership requires infrastructure, support, and trust. Right now, those foundations are cracking. If the university cannot resolve the lockout and restore access for its faculty and students, it risks not only losing millions in funding but also damaging its reputation as a place where world-class research can thrive.\nThe stakes are high, and the clock is ticking.\nNote: All numbers in this document are taken directly from Dalhousie research year-in-review documents and other published materials including public Tri-Agency funding documents."

    "title": "Lockout vs. Strike – What we are doing and why that matters",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Dalhousie Faculty Association was locked out by the administration of Dalhousie University on Wednesday, August 20th, 2025. The more astute observers might have also noticed that we called a retaliatory strike in response. This post is meant to help you understand the difference between those things and why both occur.\nA lockout and a strike are both significant events in the context of labour relations, but they are fundamentally different in their origins, processes, and impacts on workers. Understanding these distinctions is crucial to appreciating the dynamics between employees and employers, especially in complex environments like universities.\nDefining Strikes and Lockouts\nA strike is a form of collective action by workers and a constitutional right in Canada . When negotiations over issues like working conditions, pay, or benefits break down, employees represented by a union may decide to stop working as a method of protesting and applying pressure on their employer to agree to better terms. This action is almost always the result of a democratic process within the union; workers vote on whether to strike, and this vote reflects the collective will of the group.\nOn the other hand, a lockout is initiated by the employer. Instead of workers refusing to work, it is the organization that shuts down operations, preventing employees from coming to work and suspending their wages. The goal of a lockout is to compel workers to accept certain terms, usually those that the management believes are necessary for the institution’s sustainability or strategic direction.\nWho Drives the Decision?\nOne of the most significant differences is who initiates each action. A strike emerges from the grassroots — it’s worker-driven, a coordinated act of protest reflecting the collective voice. At Dalhousie University, a strike by faculty or staff would be initiated only after extensive deliberation within the DFA. While the DFA delivered a strong strike mandate, we remained committed to finding a fair deal and were prepared to continue working while we negotiated with the university.\nA lockout is decisively different in its top-down nature. At Dalhousie, the authority to enact a lockout resides with the university administration led by the president, Dr. Kim Brooks, and Board of Governors. While this decision might involve consultation with other executives and legal counsel, it ultimately is executed as a single directive. This unilaterality means that a lockout can be enacted swiftly and with little notice to staff, in stark contrast to the deliberative process required for a strike.\nHow Lockouts Impact Workers Differently\nThe impacts of lockouts are particularly keen on workers for several reasons:\n\nDuring a lockout, workers are prevented from doing their jobs and lose their regular income; the university may also restrict their access to email and other systems critical for their work, further compounding the disruption.\nUnlike a strike — where the choice to walk out is made collectively by workers — a lockout removes agency from the workforce, making them passive participants in the dispute.\nA lockout can be indefinite or short-term, with the administration controlling the timeline and conditions for workers’ return. This creates significant uncertainty and financial hardship for faculty and staff, potentially pressuring them to accept terms they find unfavourable.\n\nThese last two impacts are important for understanding why the DFA was required to call a retaliatory strike, as now the decision to return to work rests at the bargaining table, not in the hands of the administration.\n\n\nAt institutions like Dalhousie, a lockout’s effect ripples beyond faculty and staff to disrupt classes, research, and campus life, with students and the broader academic community all feeling the consequences.\nWhy Organizations Turn to Lockouts\nEmployers like universities may use a lockout as a strategic tool during tense negotiations. For example, if faculty threaten to strike during contract talks (the DFA was very clear that we did not want to strike and would only do so as a very last resort), Dr. Kim Brooks and the Board of Governors might perceive a lockout as a pre-emptive move to gain leverage. The university is then able to reset negotiations and, if desired, eventually bring staff back under new terms or a renewed collective agreement.\nA fundamental legal aspect is that both strikes and lockouts must comply with local labour laws. In Nova Scotia and across Canada, there are procedures and requirements for notice and the negotiation process before either can occur, ensuring that such actions are not arbitrary but subject to checks and balances. In this case, all legal requirements were followed, but Dalhousie took the unprecedented step of calling a lockout before the DFA had concluded its vote on the University’s “final” offer. For more information on Canadian labour relations, see this FAQ from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (CIRB).\nDecision-Making at the Top\nWhat makes a lockout unique is the level of centralized decision-making involved. While a president like Dr. Kim Brooks will almost certainly seek input from her executive team, labour relations experts, and the board, the authority rests with her.\nConclusion\nIn summary, while both strikes and lockouts bring campus operations to a halt, the core difference lies in who is in the driver’s seat: strikes are a response by workers to employer conditions, and lockouts are an employer’s response to labour unrest. Each has deep and lasting impacts on the university community."

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover? Let us know at dfa.daily.bulletin@gmail.com.\n\n\nThe DFA Will Weather this Storm!\nWhile Monday marked our fourth day of walking the line, it also marked the beginning of our second work week locked out by our employer. As predicted, it was also our first day in the rain! We’re all very happy to see the province get a soaking but, as it turns out, a lot of us were also happy to show the strength of our resolve in the weather!While the office tried to call people in when the rain became especially heavy, some members wiped the rain off and said “Hell no! We won’t go!” and stayed on the line. One of our friendly neighbourhood Bulletin editors drove by the line during the rush-hour tempest and was pleased to hear the sound of their horn drowned out by all of the others! \n\n\n\nPicket Line News and Updates\nA few points that our intrepid Job Action office wants us to pass on that we hope will reassure everyone and gear them up for the week!\n\nAn email should be coming today with reminders of the details on the pay rates and schedule. A reminder that if you have any trouble with pay once it’s gone out, to please contact the amazing Kristin Hearn in the DFA office: kristin.hearn@dal.ca. Remember, even though we only picket 5 days a week, we get paid for 7!\nWe’ve also had inquiries from people on our virtual duties campaign: thank you for your patience! We are getting things up and running, and we will be back in touch soon. In the meantime, you will be paid like everyone else, not to worry!\nThere is a Lost and Found in the SUB for Halifax picketers.\nLast but the opposite of least: a Call for Shout-Outs! We received this great idea from member Sarah Jane Dooley: a “Shout Out Series!” If you know someone on the picket line who’s been keeping spirits high, spreading positivity, or showing up with extra heart, then send us a quick shout-out for the newsletter. Let’s celebrate the folks who make this movement stronger every day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolidarity and Support\nToday’s “solidarity and support” comes from parents of the students who are currently arriving to Dalhousie, only to find they have no idea when their term will start. This time of year is usually busy for all the members of our union, but without even trying we often share in the sheer excitement of students on their arrival at campus.\n\nThis year feels different because of the President’s decision to lock us out and the Board’s refusal to bargain. The parents of those students recognize this fact, as you can see in the letter that has been sent to President Brooks from parents in Halifax, elsewhere in Nova Scotia, Ontario, and maybe further.\n\nHere’s the form letter. Know a Dalhousie parent who might appreciate it? Feel free to share. \n\n“As parents of an incoming [insert Faculty or program] student, we have been watching the contract dispute between Dal and the DFA unfold.\n\n”I understand we do not have all of the background, financial details or information that the board does, but as a tuition payer expecting to pay MANY thousands of dollars over the next several years, we respectfully request that the board return to negotiations and/or agree to arbitration with DFA as soon as possible. \n\n“It is unfair to use current and future students, as well as research grants and projects, as pawns in this chess game. Paying thousands of dollars per semester is stressful enough without the uncertainty of knowing if there will be classes to attend, credits to achieve, or if schedules will be upended and study breaks nullified.\n\n”PLEASE return to talks with the DFA, now, so a contract can be negotiated before the start of the school year.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\nStay tuned for details about Friday’s rally event: we don’t want to spill the beans before things are set, but we’re trying to cook something up!\nIn our previous issue, we mentioned the Solidarity Hub in Halifax at the SUB, and we wanted to pass on details from our wonderful counsellor colleagues:\n\n\nDFA Job Action Solidarity Hub\nWe know that recent events may be bringing up a range of emotions for our DFA members. In this time of uncertainty, the DFA is setting up a Job Action Solidarity Hub to support one another through collective care and radical rest.\n\nLocation: Strike Headquarters, Student Union Building (SUB), Room 302\nHours: Open daily during job action from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM\n\nThis space is designed to be a welcoming, supportive environment where members can:\n\nGather information regarding mental health resources that are available for DFA members\nLearn strategies to prevent burnout during this challenging period\nConnect with colleagues in a spirit of solidarity\nShare experiences and emotions around the current situation\nEnjoy refreshments before or after picket duty\nLeave and receive uplifting messages on our anonymous “collective care” message board.\n\nWellness activities will be offered regularly. \nSpecial guests: Risser and Luna, DFA’s own therapy dogs will be stopping by now and then for some much-needed four-legged furry support!\nAll DFA members are warmly welcome.\n\n\nSolidarity Hub Schedule (Week of August 25)\nWe will have the following suggested events this week. Please join us for some light refreshments and collective care! We have “themes” but you are always welcome to inquire about topics of interest to you. We are here to support each other! \n\nTUESDAY: Drop In Cookie Decorating! Theme of the day will be discussing the “new normal” and creating a routine during the strike.\nWEDNESDAY: Luna the Therapy Dog! Theme of the day will be talking about burnout and self care.\nTHURSDAY: Risser the Therapy Dog! Theme of the day will be a discussion around coping during these stressful times.\nFRIDAY: Drop in tea/coffee before rally. Discussion based on what is brought up by attendees (how to work through emotions, processing experiences, needs, etc)."

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop Dictating; Start Negotiating: Leadership Addresses the Binding Arbitration Statement\nYou will now have seen President Dave Westwood’s strong response to what he calls–accurately–the Board’s latest “weird behaviour.” If you haven’t read it yet, we encourage you to check it out on our new public-facing website, http://keepdalstrong.ca/. Here’s a direct link to the statement.\n\nWe won’t rehash what Dave says so well, but do think it’s worth expressing how frustrated, disappointed, and upset we all are at the board’s continued bad behaviour. Our headline again comes from Dave who tossed this nugget out while chatting with members at the Solidarity Hub in the SUB. The Board needs to learn that its job is to negotiate a deal with us, not dictate terms to us.\n\nWe will not let them tell us only one part of our proposal is worthy of response! As Dave says, \n“The Board did not communicate that their ‘offer’ to proceed to interest arbitration is conditional on the DFA dropping all unresolved proposals. In other words, it would be an interest arbitration on the sole issue of the IMC.\n“As a reminder, we have many proposals still on the table that deal with important issues to our Members: conversion of ‘long-term’ limited-term appointments to career-stream appointments; expanded parental leave benefits; expanded access to childcare; increased flexibility in class scheduling policies to acknowledge caregiving responsibilities. Many of these proposals would provide clear and immediate benefits to early-career academics who are clearly struggling with many economic and other challenges.”\nWe will update you when and as we can on the Executive’s discussion if these developments, but for now we know who we are and what we stand for. One Day Longer, One Day Stronger!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday Rally and “Chalk and Talk”\nThe Job Action team sent the below around yesterday, but we want to remind you that Friday’s day of action will look a little different than our usual activities. We really hope the “Chalk and Talk” (which one committee member is… a little too proud of coining) will be an opportunity to spread positivity and actual information to the students and their families and friends, rather than the misinformation the Board and Administration are spreading. After all, we’re educators, and we can teach them the difference!\nAnd we’re very excited for our noon rally on Friday!  Read more below.\n\nThank you for the remarkable work you all have been doing as we close in on our first full week of job action! Although this lockout has been imposed upon us by the Board, our collective response has been amazing and only possible because of your efforts.\n\nGiven this important milestone, as well as the increased presence of students and parents on campus as we approach the start date of term, we are planning a special day of job action for this Friday, August 29, ahead of labour day weekend.\n\n*Halifax - Special Duties*\nInstead of running our regular picket lines, we are going to have Halifax picketers meet with your picket captains at the Student Union Building, Rm 302. There we will have supplies for the start of every normally scheduled picket line for you to head out for a “Chalk and Talk” action - we’ll provide your picket line with posters (and tape), chalk, and information sheets to share with students (and parents) on campus to let them know about what’s at stake with the Board’s decision to lock out the faculty and why we need the Board to come back to the bargaining table and help us get a fair collective agreement rather than compromise the academic term.\n\nYou’ll still show up and finish at your regular time, but we’ll be sending you out with your picket captains in smaller groups to get the word out and engage with students and their families arriving on campus. We’ll have talking points to share with you to help engage with students and let them know that we all want to get back to our jobs with a fair deal for our membership.\n\n\n*Truro Members*\nInstead of running our regular picket lines in Truro, we’ve arranged for a bus to transport you in to join your colleagues in Halifax for our mid-day rally. If you want to make use of the bus, pick up will be at 9:30 am in front of the MacRae Library at 35 College Road in Bible Hill. You will then arrive in Halifax for the mid-day rally, and afterwards will be picked up in front of the Killam Library at 1:30 in order to depart Halifax to return to Bible Hill.\n\n\n*Mid-day Rally*\nTo complement our outreach and engagement with students, we will also be holding a rally in front of Killam Library (where colleagues from Truro will be joining!). The rally begins at 12 noon and will last approximately 40 minutes. We will be asking you to invite all students you speak to join our rally, which will feature the President of CAUT, Robin Whitaker, our own President Dave Westwood, and Ajay Parasram, one of the members of our Job Action Committee. We’ll also have freezies to distribute to students (and members) during the event.\n\nWe encourage all DFA members to join this rally. Attendance is voluntary and in addition to your participation in scheduled picket shifts for the special duties for Friday. For logistics, please talk to your picket captain.\n\nWe hope to see you at the rally, and our thanks again for all your efforts during our job action!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLTA Letter of Support\nMany of you will have seen the email below, but we wanted to bring it to your attention again in case you missed it in the rush of communications.\nThe Board of Governors’ “final” offer disregarded the needs of LTA instructors, a critical component of our university, leaving them in a precarious position. Many LTAs are currently being offered contracts for one-year or less, rather than three-year contracts, and expected to continue their crucial roles at Dalhousie. To continue standing in support of precarious early-career scholars with significant expenses, it is vital to remember that for our fellow LTAs, they need both an improved IMC and contracts with job security. This is a critical job security issue for some of our most vulnerable faculty members. We are asking that you read the linked letter and then click at the top to offer your support by signing the letter.\n\nOur fellow LTAs are seeking your support for conversion to permanent contracts. Currently, there is no clear path to conversion to a permanent position, and the DFA’s position is that LTAs with over five years of service should be converted to permanent, stable positions. A previous letter was briefly circulated around this issue but was not fully circulated due to the lockout. This letter is an updated version to reflect the current situation. If you signed the previous letter, please sign this one as well by clicking at the top of this letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLectures on the Line\nOne of our Oxford pickets has developed an amazing activity: Lectures on the Line! Members spend 5-15 minutes sharing an element of their areas of research or teaching.  We think this is fantastic, and would especially like to encourage it while students and their families are around. Let’s remind them–and ourselves–of some of the primary activities that make Dalhousie great: our work and our teaching! And we can make connections and learn new things in the process? Amazing.\nLet us know if you plan some Lectures on Your Line, and we’ll advertise!\n\n\nDave Westwood Answers Anything and Everything on Reddit!\n\nCheck out Dave’s “AMA” (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit: Dave fielded questions on everything from the budget, to student anxieties about the term, to his favourite ice cream (ummm, Dave, we have questions).\n\n\nPicketing a Province Over!\nOne special shout-out to our New Brunswick colleagues, holding the line for an entire province!! Our solidarity knows no borders! Amazing job!!\n[With that, folks, your intrepid editor has to apologize for skipping the many, many other shout-outs, the new pictures from the line, and, yes, thousands of the cutest pupper pictures ever! We’ve also heard you on the playlists: said editor is rapidly trying to increase their skills with this platform; stay tuned. But it’s been a day of ups and downs, so expect some more positivity, pics, and puppies soon!]"

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\n\nChalking, Talking, Solidarity, and Back to School\nToday will be one of mixed emotions for many of us. As our colleague Krista Kesselring says in our new “Humans of Dalhousie” series, students’ excitement (and nervousness!) on the first day of Fall term is always matched by our own.\nThe administration’s lockout and refusal to bargain have taken all that away from us for now, and most upsettingly from our students. It’s… well, it’s infuriating, and it’s tremendously sad.\nBut the past week our spirits have been buoyed by all of the solidarity efforts that remind us that we are fighting for something much bigger than the first day of classes—for the future of Dalhousie. Universities are sustained by people, not buildings or cash reserves.\nOur students’ support especially has energized a lot of us, which is why we wanted to share some of their amazing social media campaigns below (and yes, as they make clear, they are better at this!).\nThis past Friday, students also joined us at the rally where, once again, other unions came out to support our fight for a fair bargaining process. CAUT’s flying pickets from across the country came to support us, too. More than one person told us they were deeply moved when our sibling unions assembled in front of a massive crowd of colleagues, allies, and students. The same solidarity and emotion were also present at the Halifax-Dartmouth Labour Council’s Labour Day BBQ, where our own Dave Westwood spoke.\nFriday was also special for the “Chalk and Talk,” about which we’ve had a lot of positive feedback! Seeing the sidewalks all over campus and beyond covered with colourful statements of support will be long remembered as a literal bright spot of this lockout. The real reward, though, was the opportunity to talk to our students and give them context for the lockout and our efforts to get back to the bargaining table—and back to work.\nWe’re still waiting for the Board to return to bargaining. But we return to the picket lines with a new schedule and new chances to meet more colleagues. The friendships forged on the picket lines last month and now in September will continue for years as well as strengthen our resolve and our solidarity. It’s solidarity that will bring this lockout to a positive end.\nSo today might be a difficult one, but we hope it’s also a reinvigorating one! Think back to these moments and remember: we’re fighting for each other to have better working conditions, for our students to have better learning conditions, and for our colleagues and communities to have hope for a better future. That’s why we’re here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Humans of Dalhousie”\nColleagues Bart Vautour and Erin Wunker have started a new series on our Instagram called “Humans of Dalhousie.” Modelled on the well-known “Humans of New York,” these stories aim not only to profile some of us (and, in a side series, “Pets of Dalhousie,” for our animal buddies!), but also to capture the sense of community that we feel and build every day. The first installment here, with Krista Kesselring, reminds us what the first day of term is all about.\n\nHUMANS OF DALHOUSIE: “FIRST WEEK WOES”: “Dalhousie’s Board is upending the normal start of semester. What did your first week of university mean to you as a student? What does it mean to you as a teacher?”\n\nDR. KRISTA KESSELRING (HISTORY) “Now, as a teacher, the first week of term is usually my favorite of the year: the charged mix of old and new, the ‘back-to-school’ energy of reconnecting with colleagues and senior students heightened by the buzz of welcoming newcomers. But back in my own first week as a student — here at Dal — I found it all vastly disconcerting. I came from rural New Brunswick — a place with roads, not streets, numbered not named — and found the ‘big city’ of Halifax in equal parts exciting and confusing (Pizza delivered to the door! Concerts at the Cohn! But also, getting very lost my first time taking the No. 1 bus, the wrong way…). Figuring out university expectations on top of the basics of city life was tough. I volunteer to teach first-year courses now, in part because I can still feel (not just remember) that ambivalence and I like to think that I can help students similarly bewildered not just learn but learn to love this place as I came to do. For many years, I was proud of being both a Dal alumna and prof, a pride I felt especially strongly in the first week of the new year.”\n\n\n\nStudent Solidarity\n\n\n\n\n\nSending huge thanks and gratitude to the students who came to our rally on Friday, to those showing support on the lines every day, and to their truly amazing efforts on social media (including one post linked below that identified some of our members’ … difficulties with the medium, which has made a few of those involved laugh out loud!). Click on the images below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour Day\nFor those unable to make it to the Halifax-Dartmouth Labour Council’s Labour Day Parade and BBQ, here are some highlights!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminders\nFrom the Job Action Committee: Thanks to our incredible librarian colleagues, Julie Marcoux, Shelley McKibbon, Jackie Phinney, and many, many more colleagues, JAC was able to get the new picket schedules out on Friday night for all 1000 of us. These went to our alt-emails: if you haven’t seen it, please check your junk folder for an email from DFA Strike Scheduling scheduling.dfastrike2025@gmail.com. Those who signed up for PayWorks should have also received their first job action pay on Friday. If there are any significant issues, please check in with Strike HQ.\nLTA Letter: A reminder to sign the letter of support for our colleagues on limited-term appointments.\n\nRead the linked letter \nClick at the top to offer your support by signing the letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShout outs from the Line\nKaren Curry, captain for the 12:45 University Ave picket, sends a big shout out to Jennifer Storm for bringing her guitar to University Ave 1245 line!"

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\nDalhousie Student Union Votes to Support DFA\n\nThe students have spoken.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant demonstrations of support our union has seen since President Brooks and her administration locked us out on August 20, the Dalhousie Student Union council, representing over 20,000 students at Dalhousie, “voted to affirm its support for DFA members, reflecting that the strength of the university community depends on the well-being of both students and faculty.”\n\nTheir statement continues,\n\nWe are strongly calling for the Board to return to the bargaining table and engage in good faith to reach a fair deal with faculty. Students, faculty, and staff are essential to the functioning of Dalhousie, and decisions that destabilize this community threaten the quality of education and well-being of students.\n\nWe, as students, know that an injury to our faculty is an injury to us all. Their fight is our fight, and we proudly stand in solidarity with the DFA.\n\n\nWe cannot imagine a stronger and more supportive message from the students we work with and teach in the classroom every term. \n\nTo see our students not only recognize the importance of the work we do as faculty members, librarians, and counsellors, but also to understand the importance of our fight for for a full and fair deal… well, it’s the most moving moment of several I have experienced in the past two weeks.\n\nThis statement also also tells us that our honest, transparent, and truthful communications about the needs of our members are resonating with students and the larger community.\n\nSo remember, when you walk your picket, or work in one of the Strike HQs, or participate in virtual duties, you are doing more than just a “shift.” You are standing up for your students, and they know it, and they appreciate it, and they want to help. With their support, we can–and we will!–create a better, more fair Dalhousie.\n\nThank you, DSU colleagues, and thank you students. With your help and support, we will get back to the bargaining table, and then we will get back to a classroom, stronger and more ready than ever.\n\n\nOn Friday, Sept 5th at 12:00 p.m., DFA members will be standing together outside the Killam Library to support precarious workers in our union.\n\nAt the rally, precarious workers will speak about their experiences, unique challenges, and the collective power we have to build a better Dalhousie for future academics. While wages are a crucial issue and DFA members are underpaid compared to other U15 schools, precarious workers like early-career scholars and LTAs have unique challenges outside of wages alone. The DFA is fighting for job stability, creative cost-of-living adjustments to match inflation, improved childcare support, and other issues to support our precarious workers.\n\n\n\nA note from our colleagues at DalSafe\n“Several folks have popped by the security house asking if they are at risk of losing their reserved parking spaces for lack of renewal. The other worry is that they may be ticketed for expired permits. Please take those concerns off the table, No loss of reserved parking and tickets for expired permits.”\n\nThey further “anticipate we will get things sorted when we all get back.”\n\nA big thank you to their team for this reassurance!!\n\n\nSolidarity Banner\n\nIf you’re on–or have passed by–our South St. picket, you’ll have seen the attached benner. We asked member Jon Shapiro for some background on it, and he kindly explained the inspiration and purpose below. We hope to see it fill up even more with statements of support, and maybe go on tour? \n\nJon writes:\n\nMy partner and I walked the National COVID Memorial Wall along the Albert Embankment in London this summer. There, people can leave a message in a heart as a memorial and words of hope and support. We thought we could do something similar in this context, so we created this banner - the Solidarity Wall - for non-DFA members of our community like students, parents, NSGEU and CUPE members, or anyone who wants to show their support for the DFA to come and sign their name and messages of support if they like. It hangs on South Street across from DalPlex from 9:00 - 4:00 until it is full or this is over.\n\n\n\n\n47 Years of the DFA: Back to the Future\n\nAs we look back over the last two weeks, we remember that our union has nearly a half-century history of action. In 2018, the DFA published 40 Years of Activism: Working for a Better Dalhousieto celebrate our 40th anniversary. As we approach our 50th, and in the midst of our continued struggle, we thought we could have a bit of a “book club” read on the line of that history.\n\nHere are some images of colleagues art different points in our history fighting for our union and for our University (notice any familiar themes…?). Thanks to all of these colleagues who went on strike to build a better Dalhousie!\n\nIt’s our time to continue that work now; let’s do them proud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShout Outs\n\nA shout out to the fabulous folks (Lisa and Christina (pictured), Saf, and crew!) at Tart & Soul Café on Coburg & Oxford who have been letting DFA picketers use their washrooms and keeping us in caffeine! If you’re down that way, check out their new space and grab a delicious cookie to say thanks!"

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\n\nIt was the worst of weeks, it was the best of weeks\nLast week was a pivotal one in our struggle to achieve a fair and full deal. Let’s just run down a few things that happened:\n\nMonday, Sept. 1: Labour Day. DFA President Dave Westwood gives a rousing speech at the Halifax-Dartmouth Labour Council BBQ, connecting our fight to the larger labour movement.\nTuesday, Sept. 2: The Dalhousie Student Union council votes to stand in solidarity with the DFA, putting the weight of 20,000 DSU members behind us! This opinion piece in The Gazette offers some reasons why.\nWednesday, Sept 3: We learn that the provincial Conciliation officer has set a date for both parties to return to the table (that meeting is scheduled for today, Monday, Sept. 8).\nThursday, Sept. 4: The administration once again tries to undermine the bargaining process, as Dave explains in unambiguous terms.\nFriday, Sept. 5: We hold our largest rally yet, with students coming out in droves to support us. More details on this tremendous event, below.\n\nBut enough of looking backward! As the latest update from our bargaining team reminds us, now is the time to look forward. The energy of Friday’s rally was invigorating for us all, and this week begins with renewed hope that the conciliation process will bring about positive results. \nBut for that to happen, we need to maintain Friday’s energy on the lines. We’ve won the first round: getting the Board back to the table. Now we need to maintain our resolve to win the second round: a fair and full deal!\n\nWe trust everyone appreciates that updates on conciliation will be shared when and as they can, and that we can’t predict how long it will take. We are committed to following the proper procedure as laid out by the Conciliation officer in order to ensure a positive resolution. But please rest assured that as soon as we can say anything, we will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday’s Rally in Support of Precarious Workers\nTo say Friday’s Rally was a success would be to trade in understatement. Congratulations to Talia Evans and the entire organization team for this one!! As the photos below show, there was a massive turnout of members, allies, and CAUT flying pickets from across the country. And, yes, we acknowledged the massive support we have received from CAUT in the form of a large (in every sense!) cheque for a million dollars.\n\nBut the most moving element of the day was seeing the vast numbers of students out to support us, many with their own handmade signs. Hearing the students start a spontaneous chant of “DFA! DFA!” outside of Hicks is a memory we will hold forever.\n\nLet’s not forget the purpose of this rally, though, as detailed in the released media advisory:\n\nApproximately 15% of DFA’s members are contract faculty without permanent employment. The DFA is committed to standing together to fight precarious employment for its membership, particularly for early career scholars and those employed via Limited Term Appointments (LTAs). The DFA is pushing for creative solutions to increase the salaries of early career scholars, and a pathway to job security via contract conversion to stable employment for long-term LTA faculty.\n\nTo say Friday’s Rally was a success would be to trade in understatement. Congratulations to Talia Evans and the entire organization team for this one!! As the photos below show, there was a massive turnout of members, allies, and CAUT flying pickets from across the country. And, yes, we acknowledged the massive support we have received from CAUT in the form of a large (in every sense!) cheque for a million dollars.\n\nBut the most moving element of the day was seeing the vast numbers of students out to support us, many with their own handmade signs.

    "text": "Have an idea for something to cover?    \n\n\n\nPresident’s Message & Executive Committee Update\nFor those who may have missed President Dave Westwood’s message last night, we reprint it in full here:\n\nI understand and appreciate that emotions are running high and that everyone is craving information and updates on a resolution to the lockout. \n\nThe Board and DFA both agreed to keep confidential all discussions and exchanges during conciliation, with any public releases to be jointly agreed by both parties. I recognize and understand why today’s release about the Conciliator ending the conciliation session does not provide much satisfaction or clarity on where things stand.\n\nI called an emergency meeting of the DFA Executive Committee tonight to brief them on what has happened, because information shared with this group can be kept confidential within the terms of our agreement and because this group has decision-making authority.\n\nHaving now been briefed, the Executive Committee understands and supports the Bargaining Team as they continue the work of negotiating (1) a collective agreement that can be recommended to the membership, and (2) a return-to-work agreement that can be recommended to the membership.\n\nWe will continue to provide you with updates within the constraints of any agreements made with the Board around confidentiality. Both parties have agreed that confidentiality is an important condition for reaching a conclusion to the lockout.\n\nPlease continue your outstanding work on our physical and virtual picket lines, as your energy, passion, and enthusiasm is helping the DFA Bargaining Team to represent your interests at the table, and the solidarity that we are building will pay dividends long into the future.\n\nIt is important that we take the Executive’s full-throated support of the bargaining team after this update to heart! We know it’s been a long three weeks, but when you think of what we have managed to do–from our rallies and fundraising, to our information campaign, to receiving the full support and solidarity of our student union and so many individual students on the line, in the SUB, and elsewhere!–we know we can keep holding the line to achieve the full and fair deal that they are working for and that we deserve.\n\nSolidarity with our students, our fellow workers, and importantly ourselves–our lines, our team, and our union will bring us to our goals!\n\n\n\nCome Out to Support the DSU Student Rally!\n\nA reminder that the Dalhousie Student Union is holding a rally today, starting at noon, in support of tuition refunds for students. The students will be meeting at the Dalhousie sign on Robie and University, and march up to the Hicks Building. DFA member Ajay Parasram will be speaking!\n\nWe encourage everyone who is available to attend to support our students as they have supported us–if you can be on campus and can attend, please do! We have also asked picket captains for the shift happening during the rally, as numbers on their lines allow, to allow some of their line to join the rally, too! \n\n\n\nCAUT Meeting\n\nWednesday, September 10 at 2 pm (Atlantic) - Members of the DFA are invited to hear from the President and Vice-President of the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT). In this short 30-minute session, Robin Whitaker and Marc Schroeder will talk about the work of CAUT, how to become more involved, and the important role of academic staff in the broader Canadian labour movement. Zoom link is below.\n\nWe also want to take this opportunity to thank CAUT for their unwavering support of our efforts. Joining rallies, organizing flying pickets and providing generous contributions from the CAUT Defense Fund, CAUT’s solidarity shows that we aren’t in this battle alone - we are backed for as long as it takes by 75,000 faculty members and their associations from coast to coast.\n\nFor the link to this online meeting, please see the email sent by Catherine Wall to membership on Sept 8th.\n\nFor more information about CAUT, please visit www.caut.ca.\n\n\n\nHumans of Dalhousie: “First Week Woes”\n\n“What did your first week of university mean to you as a student? What does it mean to you as a teacher?”\n\nChristopher Snook (Lecturer, Classics and “Introduction to Humanities and to Social Sciences ASSC 1300 and ASSC 1400”)\n\nMy name is Christopher Snook, and I am an LTA in the Department of Classics with Arabic and Religious Studies. My first week of university as a student was in 1994 when I started the Foundation Year Program at the University of King’s College. For me, the excitement of that first week was being a part of a common intellectual endeavor and undertaking. That really meant, for me, being in class, sharing with and getting to know my peers, while together we learned how to think about large, significant questions that were already a part of my life. I was getting to know myself, and doing this work in classrooms with peers was among the richest and most rewarding part of my undergraduate education. I am a teacher who is specifically appointed to two of the Faculty of Arts and Social Science’s largest classes, Intro to Humanities and Into to Social Sciences (combined is roughly 700 students). What I miss most in the current labour disruption is the opportunity to be with students who have come to our campus and to the city of Halifax to study and ask large questions, to think about meaningful issues. I am missing the opportunity to be with them at a moment in their lives when they are discovering who they are, what they might think about the world, and how they might participate in the world in new and exciting ways. My hope is that the lockout ends swiftly, for the sake of the students here, and justly and fairly for the faculty who have been locked out.\n\n\n\nPink Shirt Day\n\nMany of us will already know that for Halifax Regional Centre for Education schools, this Thursday, Sept. 11, is Stand Up Against Bullying Day. In 2007, Berwick Nova Scotia classmates David Shepherd and Travis Price bought and distributed 50 pink shirts after a student at their school was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. With that act of kindness, Pink Shirt Day was born!\n\nWe’d like to invite everyone to help stand up against bullying, either in schools or in workplaces, or anywhere, by wearing pink to the lines on Thursday!"

    "text": "Another short Bulletin today, just to remind us of today’s action and rally! We’ll return to the usual Bulletin format next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday One-Membership, One-Line Solidarity March\nAs mentioned in yesterday’s bulletin, today, in place of our usual picket lines and shifts, we will instead be asking everyone who normally pickets or performs alt-duties at a Halifax campus (and any member who can come) to gather in a rally, followed by a full-membership line, and lunch from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. This will be the only action for most members today.\n\nThis event was planned as a big THANK YOU from your Job Action Committee (JAC) to you, the members, and in turn as a show of support from the membership for our bargaining team. We’ve been out for over three weeks, and it is has been all of your collective actions, in support of our bargaining team, that have moved our struggle forward, and that helps our team continue to make progress.\n\nJAC knows that this has been difficult for everyone, and so we want to express our gratitude, and give us all a moment to come together and realize how strong and united we are!\n\nWe recognize that some people will have conflicts that can’t be changed, but we also want as many of our members as possible to gather together for one giant picket line to show our solidarity, our strength, and our resolve to save our university and our students’ education. Members in Truro and Saint John campuses and our virtual picketers are welcome to participate from their locations–let us know and send pictures or notes!\n\nWe will meet outside the Killam Library where we will host the rally with our flying pickets from our sibling CAUT-affiliated unions. Then we will march down University Ave. to Robie St.; we will then turn around (without crossing Robie)and march back until we reach the university quad. Rally marshals will be positioned throughout to help with traffic and safety, and we will have chant leaders at key points in the line. Students, allies, sibling union members, and friends and family are welcome!\n\nFor the end of the march, we have contracted with Greg Buckley, the hot dog and sausage vendor outside the SUB, to provide free hot dogs (veggie included!) and refreshments to participants! We’ll offer our brief closing remarks, then you can have a dog, chat with your colleagues and friends, mingle with folks from other lines! (But maybe don’t all go up at once–while we want the march to stretch a long way, we don’t want the lunch line to!)\n\nWe need to show the administration and the board that we are united against their underhanded dealings, and we need to show our students and the public that we will fight to bring our Dalhousie back from the brink. But we also need to remind ourselves that we, together, recreate Dalhousie every day, with every conversation, every shared laugh, and every moment of community.\n\nONE MEMBERSHIP, ONE LINE, ONE DALHOUSIE!"

    "title": "Dalhousie Board gives Faculty Members 48-hour Notice to Lockout",
    "section": "",
    "text": "(Monday, August 18, 2025 – Halifax, NS) – The Dalhousie Board of Governors issued its 48-hour notice to the Minister of Labour this morning, allowing the Board to lockout almost 1000 faculty who are members of the Dalhousie Faculty Association. The lockout could begin any time effective Wednesday, August 20, 2025.\n“This move by the Administration is reckless and will damage the reputation of the institution,” notes DFA President David Westwood. “Faculty members can’t apply for research grants, we have to pause our research, students will be second-guessing their decision to come to Dalhousie. A lockout affects every aspect of the teaching and research that happens at Dalhousie.”\nMonday, August 11, was the final meeting with provincially-appointed Conciliation Officer Rick Rose to find a tentative agreement between the two sides. The Board tabled their final offer at 10 am on August 11, and then walked away from the meeting at 12 noon without notifying the conciliator. On August 14, DFA held a virtual meeting with its DFA membership to present the Board’s final offer. Immediately following the meeting, DFA launched an e-vote on the offer, with the vote closing Thursday, August 21. The Board was advised of this timeline, yet they still announced a lockout that would occur before the voting is even completed.\n“It is important to note that this is a labour disruption initiated by the employer, not by the union,” notes Westwood. “We have been clear all along that our objective is to negotiate at the table. We want to work, and we have a lot of preparations to get ready for the fall term which will not get done if the Board goes ahead with their lockout plan. It is beyond irresponsible for the Board to suggest to students with any confidence that there will be little to no disruption to the Fall semester. By triggering a lockout during preparations for the Fall term, every minute of a lockout translates to a minute of postponement to the start of the Fall term. Whenever this labour disruption is resolved, that lost time will need to be accounted for.”\nNo other university in the “U15” has ever locked out its faculty. U15 Canada is an association of the 15 leading research universities across the country, of which Dalhousie is a member. “Throughout this entire round of bargaining the Board has been uncharacteristically aggressive in its approach and unwilling to negotiate in any meaningful way on the items of most importance to our members,” notes Westwood. “A lockout would demonstrate their complete lack of respect for our faculty, Dalhousie students, and the bargaining process.”\nOne key issue remaining on the bargaining table is the Board’s continued reliance on limited-term contracts for long-term continuing teaching needs. Another issue is making sure that wages keep pace with dramatic increases in the cost of living in Nova Scotia, a common issue confronted by every worker in this province.\n“DFA is asking for wages that keep up with inflation and make up for 9% loss in real wages we have incurred over the past 10 years,” says Westwood. “We are also fighting to keep full-time jobs from being converted to sessional contracts. If our Members had not pushed back, the Board would have pressed forward with their proposal to make 76 of our Members vulnerable to conversion to sessional contracts.”\nOther issues include expanding access to childcare and ensuring workloads are fair and reasonable.\nThe current agreement between DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors expired June 30, 2025. Negotiations began the last week of May, and after only four bargaining meetings, the Board of Governors filed for conciliation on June 2. One more bargaining meeting was held June 20, and then Rick Rose was appointed as the conciliation officer on June 23. Three conciliation meetings were held in July and the Board walked away from conciliation prematurely. Rose filed his report on June 28, triggering a 14-day waiting period which ended August 11.\nIn June, 85.5% of the DFA membership participated in a strike vote. Of those, 91.2% voted in favour of going on strike if an acceptable deal could not be reached. Now that the Board has presented its final offer, the DFA will meet with its full membership to review the final offer on the table. Members are currently voting on the Board’s most recent offer. The vote closes end of day Thursday, August 21. DFA’s Bargaining Bulletins can be found here.\n\nAbout DFA\nThe DFA is the certified bargaining agent for almost 1,000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors at Dalhousie University. As a volunteer-based organization, we advocate for the rights of our members and work to protect and advance the academic integrity of the University.\nTo arrange an interview with DFA President David Westwood: email DFA Communications Officer Catherine.Wall@dal.ca"

    "title": "DFA Rejects Dalhousie’s “Offer” of Interest Arbitration and Files Complaint with NS Department of Labour",
    "section": "",
    "text": "(Thursday, August 28, 2025 – Halifax, NS). Earlier today, the DFA Executive Committee voted to reject Dalhousie Board of Governors’ “offer” to engage in interest arbitration, and also approved the filing of a complaint with the Nova Scotia Labour Board.\nThe Board of Governors did not suggest interest arbitration at the bargaining table, rather it was delivered to DFA’s lead negotiator with a copy sent to Mr. Rick Rose, provincial conciliation officer. It was followed a few hours later with the public release to the Dalhousie community.\n“If the Board had engaged in meaningful and substantive bargaining since we first sat down late May, it is possible that we could have already ratified a new collective agreement with no disruption to the Fall semester,” says DFA President Dave Westwood. “Instead, here we are, on the picket lines and classes re were supposed to start on Tuesday.”\nInterest arbitration would focus on the single issue of the wage increase. In their public-facing message to the Dalhousie community, the Board did not communicate that their offer to proceed to interest arbitration is conditional on the DFA dropping all unresolved proposals.\n“The Board deliberately misrepresented their offer in their messaging, omitting the key detail that their proposal on interest arbitration required the DFA to abandon all unresolved proposals except wages,” says Westwood.\nThe DFA has many proposals still on the table including: conversion of “long-term” limited-term appointments to career-stream appointments; expanded parental leave benefits; expanded access to childcare; and increased flexibility in class scheduling policies to acknowledge caregiving responsibilities. These proposals would provide immediate benefits to early-career academics who are struggling with many economic and other challenges.\n“All along we have been asking the Board to come back to the table and they have refused,” says Westwood. “They created this mess by refusing to bargain, refusing to come back to the table and refusing to listen when we warned them repeatedly of the dangerous game that they were playing by threatening, and then ultimately following through with, a lockout in August.”\nThe DFA Executive Committee today also approved a motion to file a bargaining complaint with the Labour Board based on Dalhousie’s use of public messages to bargain directly with DFA Members and to circumvent bargaining at the table through appropriate channels. The complaint asks the Minister to order the Board of Governors back to the table.\n“Discussion needs to happen at the bargaining table,” says Westwood. “It’s time the Board of Governors stop undermining the integrity of the collective bargaining process and delaying the resolution of the situation.”\nDFA has been locked out since August 20, 2025. In response, the union launched a defensive strike that took effect Friday, August 22, 2025.\n\nAbout DFA\nThe DFA is the certified bargaining agent for almost 1,000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors at Dalhousie University.

    "title": "President’s Message",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dave Westwood DFA President 2025-2026\nIt was not my intention to send you another President’s Message so soon after the last one, but the Board’s latest antics have compelled me to yet again issue a message of clarification in the hopes of reducing your anxiety level, if not your anger.\nThe Board’s insistence on bargaining in public raises the serious question of an unfair labour practice, which I will ask our DFA Executive Committee to consider at a meeting tomorrow morning. It seems that the Board has unlimited time, energy, and appetite to prepare misleading and inaccurate news and social media releases, but no time to join us at the bargaining table to have an actual conversation and discussion. Every moment that they waste with such weird behaviour is another moment that delays a resolution to the crisis that they have created with their lockout.\nThe Board’s public-facing message suggests that the “labour dispute” (they are careful to avoid saying “lockout” out loud) could be resolved without disruption to the start of the Fall semester if the DFA agrees to proceed to “interest arbitration”. Let me offer a few remarks intended to provide some truth and clarity.\nBoard’s “offer” not presented in a bargaining meeting\nFirst, a serious procedural matter. This “offer” was not presented in a bargaining meeting at the table, it was delivered to our lead negotiator with a copy sent to our conciliation officer and it was followed a few hours later with the public release that you – and many Dalhousie students – have likely already seen. It is a thinly veiled attempt to seize control of sentiment across campus (and more widely) by suggesting that the Board is interested in a quick resolution to a rapidly looming crisis, and if the DFA does not agree then we will be presumably held up as being the reason that the start of term is delayed. They fail to mention that the crisis is entirely of their own making, which they created by locking out DFA Members last Wednesday.\nI would like to remind you all that we warned the Board repeatedly of the dangerous game that they were playing by threatening, and then ultimately following through with, a lockout in August. By coincidence, our bargaining team happened to be in a virtual meeting when these events were transpiring, so the team had an initial opportunity to consider the implications of a potential interest arbitration. Thursday morning our DFA Executive Committee will have the opportunity to discuss the situation, after which we will be able to share more information about what comes next.\nBoard’s “Offer” is conditional on DFA dropping all unresolved proposals\nSecond, a key omission changes everything. In their public-facing message the Board did not communicate that their “offer” to proceed to interest arbitration is conditional on the DFA dropping all unresolved proposals. In other words, it would be an interest arbitration on the sole issue of the IMC.\nAs a reminder, we have many proposals still on the table that deal with important issues to our Members: conversion of “long-term” limited-term appointments to career-stream appointments; expanded parental leave benefits; expanded access to childcare; increased flexibility in class scheduling policies to acknowledge caregiving responsibilities. Many of these proposals would provide clear and immediate benefits to early-career academics who are clearly struggling with many economic and other challenges.\nTo put this another way, if the DFA agreed to the Board’s “offer” it would mean abandoning all of these important issues for the next three years, with the hope that the Board might be in a more accommodating frame of mind next time.\nBoard denies the reality that the lockout will delay Fall semester\nThird, the Board continues to deny the reality that the Fall semester is going to be delayed because of their lockout. It is clear to everyone except the Board that the Fall semester will not start on time, and it creates false hope in students to continue suggesting otherwise. We have been locked out for a week already, at a time when most of us would have otherwise been preparing our courses to begin at the scheduled time. At a minimum, we need an additional week to do the work that we were prevented from doing by the Board’s lockout. A return-to-work timeline has never been discussed between the parties, because nothing has been discussed between the parties since August 11.\nIt is worth noting that if the Board had engaged in meaningful and substantive bargaining in all the time that was available since late May, it is possible that we could have already ratified a new collective agreement with no disruption to the Fall semester. The Board’s repeated assertion that “labour disruption was inevitable” is simply a different way of stating that the Board never intended to reach an agreement through negotiation, and always intended to use a lockout as a tool to bully DFA Members into accepting a new contract on the Board’s terms and timeline.\nAs I mentioned above, I will be discussing these issues with our Executive Committee tomorrow morning. I will provide an update as soon as possible outlining our next steps.\nSincerely,\n\nDave Westwood DFA\nDFA President"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today marks one week since DFA Members were locked out of our offices, research spaces, and technology, a day that will be burned in our memories forever. It is almost one week since we announced that we had rejected the Board’s best and final offer.\nWe have formally notified the Board’s bargaining team that we would like to meet to negotiate an improved offer that DFA Members would find satisfactory, and we are in regular communication with our conciliator. To date we have had no formal acknowledgment of our request to resume bargaining, and therefore no scheduled dates for further discussions. Our top priority is to resume negotiations – we want to work, and we want to talk. After all, we are academics and we love what we do.\nIt is not entirely surprising that the Board’s team is dragging their heels. Presumably part of the rationale for locking us out is to save money, at least in the notional sense: they are saving approximately $2.8M per week in DFA salaries alone during the lockout. That said, there are additional costs and expenses incurred by their reckless and disrespectful action such as the potential loss of student enrolment and tuition, the loss of grants that could not be submitted, and the reputational and relational costs that are far greater than any number of dollars and cents. And let me be clear: the Board’s cost of a settlement is growing as the lockout continues.\nWith each dollar saved on our backs, the Board will need to improve their offer by a proportionate amount, whether in the form of a stronger cost of living adjustment, or by agreeing to our other proposals on LTA conversion and benefits that will improve the working conditions of our early-career academics in particular.\nAs students return to our campuses in droves the pressure on the Board to return to the table will become immense, so I do expect that we will see movement on an improved offer in the next week or so. Of course, I cannot promise anything, and I would caution us all that a satisfactory resolution to the current impasse could take several weeks. This is why we need to remain strong and united on our picket lines, and to keep our energy and resolve as the Board continues to harm us and our families with their oppressive lockout.\nOur Job Action Committee is working around the clock to make sure that we are all supported during this stressful time, and our Communications squad is doing everything possible to generate pressure on the Board to return to the table, and to respond positively to our demands. Each of you can use your networks and social media savvy to help us amplify messages and increase our reach and impact. If you have a creative idea for a media-based campaign, please feel free to share! With 1000 academic staff in our union, we have an unrivalled amount of intellectual and creative potential. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for an AMA (“ask me anything” – a live chat session with questions and answers) on Reddit geared towards Dalhousie students possibly as early as this afternoon.\nLet me share my thoughts on the fate of the Fall semester. The timeline for a return to work is now a part of the negotiations at the table, and it is the DFA’s position that the time lost due to the lockout is now gone, and will need to be replaced by delaying the start of the Fall semester by some substantial amount of time. As you all know, it will take a significant amount of time to get your courses, labs, and practical experiences prepared, which is work you have not been able to do while locked out and deprived of your salary.\nThe analogy I have been using is that of an industrial context where workers on an assembly line are locked out by the employer: during the lockout the assembly line produces no widgets, and when the workers ultimately return to the line they begin to produce widgets at the usual pace and the widget deficit will require time to erase – if the employer requires more widgets to fulfill an order to a customer, then that order will be delayed by the duration of the lockout. Hopefully it goes without saying that I am not equating the nature of our work to the production of widgets, but I hope the analogy captures the reality that the lockout has produced a deficit in work that cannot simply be conjured up overnight when this dispute is resolved. We will all need time to get prepared for what promises to be a busy and challenging academic year.\nMany of you have asked about the possibility of binding arbitration as an ‘off-ramp’ to the current impasse. Labour law in Nova Scotia requires both parties to consent to binding arbitration. It is possible that at some point binding arbitration might be attractive to both parties, but it is important for DFA Members to be aware that while agreeing to proceed to binding arbitration would resolve the issue of wages (i.e., the arbitrator would award a wage settlement based on arguments and evidence advanced by both parties), it is probable that none of our other “language” proposals would be addressed or resolved. This means we would likely not make any progress on issues that we know are priorities for the membership, such as a pathway to permanence for limited-term appointments, and expanded childcare and parental leave benefits. We need to return to negotiations at the table to make progress on all of our bargaining priorities since we know wages are not the only issue that matters. To put it another way, binding arbitration would be premature at this time, as it would short-circuit critical negotiations on important issues.\nWe will share updates as they become available. For now, please stay strong, and keep your energy and enthusiasm up!\nDave"

    "text": "Dave Westwood, DFA President\nGood morning colleagues,\nWe are about to enter week 3 of the lockout and the Board continues to ignore our demand to return to the bargaining table to resolve our remaining proposals and conclude a new collective agreement. We have not heard back on the next steps for our bargaining complaint against the Board but that will likely take some time to process. So what comes next?\nOur next step is to continue increasing the pressure on the Board to return to the bargaining table. There is rapidly increasing pressure now that the majority of students have returned to campus, and it has now become crystal clear that classes will not start on time and are likely to be delayed by at least a week even if an agreement could be reached today. Those of you who teach in accredited programs like Nursing know that there is little room for compression or disruption to the Fall teaching schedule before serious knock-on effects emerge that put not only the Fall semester in jeopardy but the entire academic year. \nLast week our DFA Bargaining Team and Executive Team agreed that we should continue negotiations rather than accepting the Board’s so-called offer to jointly agree to an interest arbitration that would focus exclusively on the issue of the IMC (i.e., wages) and require us to abandon all DFA proposals still on the table. As a reminder, our remaining proposals include: expanding access to childcare; increased parental leave top-ups; converting limited term appointments that have been already renewed for 5 years into career-stream appointments; and increased Health Spending Account.\nThe Board’s rationale for summarily rejecting these proposals is that they cannot afford the associated costs. I would like to point out that the conversion of long-term LTAs into career-stream appointments would cost very little since salary scales are the same for LTA and career-stream appointments. Such conversions would save a lot of time and work for DFA Members since search committees could focus on other duties instead of regularly reviewing and interviewing people for reappointment. Increasing parental-leave top-ups would also cost very little because (1) very few DFA Members access the benefit each year, (2) the increased benefit would only be for a few months, and (3) the benefit is a top-up that sits on the benefits already provided through the Employment Insurance (EI) program.\nSome of you have reached out to ask why DFA leadership did not bring the question of interest arbitration to a full vote of the membership. Such a vote would have been a ratification vote, since agreeing to the Board’s proposal would have concluded collective bargaining. The decision to proceed to a ratification vote rests with the Executive Committee, per our bylaws (Article 7; Clause 7.1.2):  https://immediac.blob.core.windows.net/dfa2021/images/WP-content/uploads/2011/03/DFA.Bylaws.pdf\n\nThe Executive Committee considered and ultimately rejected the idea of conducting a ratification vote. When there is a new offer from the Board the Bargaining Team and Executive Committee will again turn their minds to the question of whether or not to conduct a ratification vote.\nIt is worth noting that at no point has the topic of a return-to-work protocol been discussed or negotiated by the parties. This key issue would need to be resolved before a work stoppage could be concluded – the Board’s repeated assertions to students that classes could resume quickly once an agreement is reached is not within their power to dictate.\nMany Members and students have asked how long it might take for classes to resume once a deal is reached. As noted above, a return-to-work protocol is something negotiated between the parties along with the collective agreement itself. Our bylaws provide that a return-to-work protocol must respect the time necessary to prepare for a return to regular duties after a work stoppage, and that the membership must have the opportunity to hear about and indeed vote on both the tentative agreement and the return-to-work protocol. While the bylaws state that a minimum of 24 hours shall be required to return to work after agreeing to conclude a stoppage, we will obviously require considerably more than this because the Board’s ill-advised lockout prevented us from several weeks of much-needed preparation time for our classes, labs, and other academic activities.\nI look forward to joining you all on our freshly constituted and greatly expanded picket lines both in Halifax and Truro in the coming week. We must keep our spirits up, and stay strong. The balance of pressure has tipped heavily into our favour as the Board now has to confront directly the mounting costs and consequences of each day that classes are delayed. Thus far the Board has been able to save money by withholding our wages with relatively little consequence, but that is about to change dramatically as they must now seriously consider the financial consequences of student withdrawals and demands for tuition refunds. As grant application deadlines also rapidly approach, there is the further risk of a serious loss of grant capture and the loss of associated revenue from the indirect costs of research program. I would like to point out that the Board could fund almost all of our remaining proposals out of the savings already realized from withholding our salaries during their lockout, so it is no longer defensible for them to refuse our demands on the grounds of affordability – this was not true before the lockout and it is even further from the truth now.\nWe look forward to seeing you at our third lockout rally this Friday and welcoming back our friends and colleagues from the CAUT Flying Pickets and other local unions and labour leaders who will join us. The rally is scheduled for Friday, September 5 at 12 noon in front of the Killam Library.\nIn solidarity,\n\nDave Westwood\nDFA President 2025-2026"

    "text": "David Westwood\nI understand and appreciate that emotions are running high and that everyone is craving information and updates on a resolution to the lockout.\nThe Board and DFA both agreed to keep confidential all discussions and exchanges during conciliation, with any public releases to be jointly agreed by both parties. I recognize and understand why today’s release about the Conciliator ending the conciliation session does not provide much satisfaction or clarity on where things stand.\nI called an emergency meeting of the DFA Executive Committee tonight to brief them on what has happened, because information shared with this group can be kept confidential within the terms of our agreement and because this group has decision-making authority.\nHaving now been briefed, the Executive Committee understands and supports the Bargaining Team as they continue the work of negotiating (1) a collective agreement that can be recommended to the membership, and (2) a return-to-work agreement that can be recommended to the membership.\nWe will continue to provide you with updates within the constraints of any agreements made with the Board around confidentiality. Both parties have agreed that confidentiality is an important condition for reaching a conclusion to the lockout.\nPlease continue your outstanding work on our physical and virtual picket lines, as your energy, passion, and enthusiasm is helping the DFA Bargaining Team to represent your interests at the table, and the solidarity that we are building will pay dividends long into the future.\nSincerely,\n\nDave Westwood\nDFA President 2025-2026"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This second update provides students with key information about the contract negotiations happening between Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) and the Dalhousie Board of Governors. This gives an overview of the issues at the heart of this round of collective bargaining.\nDFA wants to continue bargaining, but Dalhousie Board of Governors has so far not accepted our invitation to come back to the table. If you have concerns about how this situation will affect the fall term, please contact:\nVice-Provost Student Affairs\nDr. Rick Ezekiel\nrick.ezekiel@dal.ca\n902-494-8021\nAssistant Vice-Provost Student Engagement and Success Quenta Adams quenta.adams@dal.ca 902-494-1924 \nBargaining Highlights As explained in Student Update Part 1, the DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors (the Board) began negotiations on May 26, 2025. On June 2, after only a few days of bargaining, the Board filed for conciliation. The DFA contested the filing, saying it was premature and full discussions on many proposals had not yet taken place. The Minister of Labour agreed to wait until the DFA Bargaining Team and the Board’s team met one last time on June 20.\nOn June 23, the Labour Board appointed a conciliation officer and conciliation meetings were held July 9, July 15 and July 16. Midway through the July 16 session, the Board presented a ‘best and final offer’ and withdrew from further discussions, leaving several outstanding matters unresolved, despite progress being made.\nAs is typical in bargaining, the conciliator meets with both sides to try and reach agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the conciliator files a “no board report” with the Minister of Labour, which triggers a 14-day countdown. At the end of that 14-day period, the employer could lock out employees or the union could go on strike.\nIn DFA’s case, the conciliator is scheduled to file a “no board report” on July 28, which means the Board could lock out faculty members at midnight on Monday, August 11 at the earliest. We are concerned that the Board’s procedural choices and rapid escalation signal a lockout strategy. The DFA will not initiate a strike in August.\nThe Main Issues Typically, in conciliation, the two sides discuss the few remaining items not agreed to in bargaining. We were making progress in several areas including moving expenses, Indigenous ceremonial leave and some workload proposals. However, because the Board filed for conciliation prematurely, and walked away from conciliation while DFA was still ready to bargain, these items and many others are still on the table.\nSalary The DFA is currently proposing a salary increase (also known as the Income Maintenance Change, or IMC) of: 7% in the first year; 4% in the second and 4% in the third. We moved from our initial proposal of 9%, 6% and 6%. The Board is offering 2% in each year, up only .25% a year from their original offer before conciliation.\nIt is important to note that the Board’s salary offer is tied to a major change in the 90-10 Clause (see p. 3) that would allow the Board to employ more sessional instructors to replace work normally done by DFA Members. They are not offering a conditions-free cost-of-living adjustment. The Board’s proposal of an increase close to the expected level of inflation depends on accepting a dramatic change to the academic staffing at the institution. This change would affect DFA members who could lose their jobs, and it would impact the student experience, as more sessional (part time) instructors will be teaching your courses.\nFor the past year, the Board has talked about the grave financial situation facing Dalhousie. The DFA has asked the Board on several occasions to help us understand the financial situation and its impact on operations. Despite our requests, we have not received adequate explanation and we are concerned with the apparent lack of a plan to ensure the integrity of the academic programs at Dalhousie. Several aspects of the operating budget lack transparency or detailed explanation. The Board has a long history of moving substantial funds out of the operating budget and into capital projects to fund things like buildings and the new arena. Between 2003 and 2021, Dalhousie’s financial statements show a cumulative operating surplus of more than $464M, yet they are now somehow facing a significant deficit that they are using to implement extreme operational cutbacks. Dalhousie’s historical surpluses and discretionary capital expenditures suggest sufficient flexibility to fund cost-of-living adjustments for academic staff. Over the past three Collective Agreements, the salary increases negotiated with the Board have fallen short of inflation. As a result, DFA Members have in essence, incurred a wage cut of almost 9% in real terms over the past decade.\nFor five years the Board offered salary increases below 2% (the normal expected level of inflation). Then, in the years when the Board agreed to raises above 2%, inflation was much higher than expected (e.g., up to 7.53% in 2022). In this 2025 round of bargaining, salary increases must make up for the 9% accumulated wage cut and ensure that we do not slide further behind the expected increase in cost of living.\nIt is the Board’s responsibility to pay fair wages to the employees who do the critical work of the institution. Fair wages help us keep pace with the cost of living in Nova Scotia. It is the only way to continue recruiting top quality faculty.\nThe 90-10 Clause The 90-10 clause – dating back to 1978 - ensures that no less than 90% of the teaching is done by DFA Members, with a maximum of 10% allocated to non-DFA Members (e.g., CUPE 3912 sessional instructors and non-unionized instructors). The Board is proposing a change to the 90-10 clause that would allow them to eliminate up to 76 full-time, tenure/tenure track faculty positions, and and increase their reliance on precarious, lower-paid academic staff.\nThe 90-10 rule protects the integrity and quality of academic work at Dalhousie, and enables the DFA to protect the working conditions of the majority of academic staff at the institution. It is fundamental to our purpose and values as a faculty association.\nLibrarian Appointments and Workload The Board proposes to change the way librarians are appointed, from being appointed to a specific to an appointment to the library system. So, our librarians could be in the Law Library one term, and in the Health Sciences Library the next; in the MacRae Library in Truro one year and the Killam in Halifax the next. No specialty, no consistency. The Board also proposes to remove provisions for librarian workload, including overtime.\nChild Care and Parental Leave All of the DFA proposals targeted to improve working conditions for less senior faculty with families remain on the table. To date, the Board has declined to support any of the DFA’s proposals in this area, including: improving child care, extending parental leave top-up and academic scheduling to address caregiver responsibilities.\nAbuse of Limited-Term Appointments (LTAs) The Board has not been willing to discuss converting LTAs that have existed for over five years. Some of our DFA members have been in limited-term positions since as far back as 2008.\nIndigenous Leave The Board has not agreed to adequate leave for Indigenous members to engage in days of importance, traditional, and cultural Indigenous practices, and ceremonies and celebrations.\nHealth Spending Account Despite a majority of DFA members using the maximum amount of their Health Spending Account, the Board has not agreed to an increase despite the growing needs of members.\nRetirement Incentive The Board has no interest in discussing a retirement incentive program, even though it would save money in its budget. Paying senior faculty is far more expensive than paying those early in their career.\nProfessional Counsellors: Cost of Professional Fees and Workload The Board will not discuss covering the costs of professional fees for Professional Counsellors who are hired to provide important mental health services for students that require them to be licensed. Additionally, the Board won’t discuss proper hours of work for Professional Counsellors.\nAugust Disruption Jeopardizes the Fall Term A lockout in August causes significant disruption for not only faculty, but for students and their families, and puts the success of the fall term in jeopardy. Students attending classes over the summer will have their studies interrupted, move-in dates may be affected, even the decision of whether or not to come to Dalhousie or continue your studies at our university could be impacted. Faculty are being forced to shift their focus from preparing your courses to contingency planning , a consequence of the unresolved bargaining situation. The DFA Bargaining Team remains ready and willing to bargain, and we encourage the Board to come back to the table."

    "title": "Dalhousie Lockout Leaves International Students in Limbo",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On August 20, President Dr. Kim Brooks, The Dalhousie Administration, and the Board of Governors locked out faculty, forcing the Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) off the job. The faculty did not want this fight. We were ready to keep teaching, researching, mentoring, and working while negotiations continued. But the University did not want to bargain, and beyond a bargaining tactic a lockout is a top-down order that shuts classrooms, freezes research, and cuts off mentorships. It punishes students as collateral damage, and at Dalhousie those consequences fall hardest on international students, the very group the university can least afford to lose.\nInternational students are the financial backbone of Canada’s universities, and Dalhousie is no exception. Depending on their program and living arrangements, their costs are staggering. For international undergraduates, the total annual cost including tuition, fees, housing, and meals typically falls somewhere between the mid-$30,000s and the mid-$50,000s.1 On top of these costs, other cost of living expenses can add another CAD $14,000 to $26,000 annually, depending on personal circumstances. Taken together, total yearly costs can easily climb past CAD $55,000 and, for some programs and housing choices, even exceed CAD $70,000. Families abroad shoulder these immense financial commitments with the expectation of steady academic progress in return.\nBut when faculty are locked out, those expectations collapse. Tuition bills still arrive even when classes don’t. Study permits require continuous enrollment, so prolonged disruption risks making students non-compliant and jeopardizing their right to stay in Canada. It can also throw off graduation timelines, forcing students to spend additional months or even years in Canada. That means more tuition, more rent, and more living expenses—costs that families overseas never planned for. It’s an everyday anxiety that weighs on their sleep, their focus, and their sense of stability.\nBeyond the immediate stress on students, the lockout is also damaging Dalhousie’s standing abroad. This reputational damage is just as real and impactful.\nInternational enrolment at Dalhousie dropped from 4,481 in 2023–24 (2,821 undergrad and 1,560 grad) to 3,676 in 2024–25 (2,282 undergrad and 1,384 grad). That loss of 805 students in a single year, a 20% decline. While this is a warning siren for the university’s finances, it was also predicted, expected, and should have been planned for. We have known that this was coming, and the administration of a public service institution like Dalhousie should have had better foresight.\nAnd yet, the Board of Governors and Dr. Brooks have chosen a path almost guaranteed to accelerate the decline by choosing to lockout and maintain the lockout of faculty. Families abroad are paying attention, and many will think twice before sending their children to a university that locks out its own faculty and leaves students in limbo. Each student who chooses Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal over Halifax is another financial loss for Dalhousie. In today’s global education market, reputation is currency, and Dalhousie is spending it fast.\nFaculty are not a threat to Dalhousie’s future; they are its foundation. They are the ones who teach, mentor, and drive the research that gives Halifax its place on the map. By resisting the lockout, faculty are not only protecting their own livelihoods but also safeguarding the quality of education that every student depends on. Supporting them means supporting the very idea of the university as a place where education is a public good, not a bargaining chip.\nThe real threat comes not from faculty, but from the administration’s decision to escalate the conflict. The administration has chosen to gamble that it can win this standoff through force. The costs of that gamble will not fall on administrators. They will be carried by students who see their studies disrupted, by Halifax businesses that rely on those students, and by a university reputation that is already under strain. The longer the lockout continues, the more lasting the damage will be.\nThis is not a dispute the public can afford to ignore. Standing with faculty is not just about taking sides in a labour negotiation; it is about calling out failed leadership before it hollows out one of Canada’s great universities.\nEndnotes:\n1.
