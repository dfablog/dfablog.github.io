    "text": "Faculty members understand the pressure that a possible interruption of classes puts on students and their families. The DFA is doing its best to get back to the table and negotiate an agreement. In the meantime, we know you have questions and we have done our best to answer them here. If there are other questions you have, please send them along to 2025.strike.dfa@dal.ca and we will do our best to answer them.\n\nAre the DFA and Dalhousie Board of Governors still at the bargaining table?\nThe DFA has asked the Board repeatedly to come back to the bargaining table. So far, the Board has refused to bargain more than a handful of times. The last meeting took place July 16 and the Board has been unwilling to come back to the bargaining table since then to try and negotiate an agreement.\nDFA President Dave Westwood contacted Dalhousie President Kim Brooks on June 28 in an attempt to get the two sides back to the table. President Brooks was unable to accommodate a meeting due to her busy summer schedule.\nBoth sides are scheduled to meet with the conciliator on Monday, August 11 to try and reach an agreement before any job action is taken.\n\n\nAre faculty members going to strike? And if so, when would it happen?\nWhen talking about “job action”, it is important to note the difference between a strike and a lockout.\nA lockout is a situation where an employer temporarily closes a workplace or suspends work to pressure employees or their union to accept specific employment terms: equally importantly the employer stops paying the workers. It’s a form of employer-driven leverage in labour disputes.\nA strike is a work stoppage where employees collectively refuse to work to exert pressure on their employer during contract negotiations: the employer would stop paying workers during a strike. The purpose of a strike is to disrupt normal business operations and compel the employer to meet their demands.\nFor students, the end result is same – work by DFA members stops.\nThe DFA has no intention of triggering a strike in August. We want students in classes this summer to continue their studies uninterrupted. We also want students coming for the fall term to have chance to move in and get settled.\nAny work stoppage in August will be the result of the Board choosing to lockout DFA Members. If the Board decides to make that move, the earliest you could expect job action is August 12.\n\n\nWhat is the DFA asking for?\nThere are many issues that have not been agreed to at the table, the main ones are:\nThe Board wants to change the collective agreement to allow more teaching to be done by precarious sessional and contract instructors. Sessional and contract faculty are paid far less than full-time positions and they do not receive the same benefits, and most of them do not conduct research.\nThe DFA is asking for reasonable salary increases, in line with what other universities pay their teachers, scholars, and librarians. The Board is demanding that DFA accept wages below inflation, which amounts to a wage cut.\nSalary that does not keep pace with inflation, and an increase in classes being taught by sessional and contract faculty will continue to chip away at the academic mission of Dalhousie. We know our working conditions are your learning conditions and we want to keep Dalhousie strong. To do that the DFA is asking for a fair contract for its members.\nTo learn more about the DFA’s bargaining positions, read Student Update #2.\n\n\nIf there is a work stoppage, how long will it last?\nIn the last four rounds of bargaining (2021,2017, 2020 and 2022), the DFA and the Board reached agreement in conciliation. (Conciliation is a common part of the bargaining process where a provincially-appointed conciliation officer works with both sides to try and find an agreement. If conciliation fails, either side can initiate job action – a lockout by the employer, or a strike by the union.) We are hopeful that we can reach agreement without work stoppage again this year.\nThe Dalhousie Board has never locked out faculty. For Dalhousie to do so this year would be an unprecedented move among the leading 15 research-intensive universities in Canada. If they do indeed initiate a lockout, we have no idea how long they would keep us locked out.\nThe DFA has not been on strike since 2002. The strike lasted almost four weeks. In Canada’s post-secondary sector, the average length of a strike is three weeks.\nIf labour disruption occurs, it could jeopardize the fall term depending on how long it lasts.\n\n\nIf there is a work stoppage, what activities will be interrupted?\nThe list of activities at all campuses that will be interrupted includes:\n\nAll in-person and online classes taught by approximately 1000 DFA professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors would be cancelled;\nAccess to course materials, tests, grading, and communication with students on academic matters would be cancelled;\nSenate will be suspended;\nSupervision of research students (both undergraduate and graduate) will be paused;\nThesis defences, other presentations, and access to librarians will stop;\nThere will be reduced access to some counselling services.\nInternships and practica may be disrupted depending on the specific details and supervisory responsibilities. \n\n\n\nCan I cross the picket line?\nThere will be picket lines at various places around campus in Halifax and Truro. To get to the campus you may have to cross the picket line. Our faculty members will not prevent you from doing so.\n\n\nHow can students keep their studies moving forward?\nIf a lockout occurs this summer, and you are taking classes, we suggest that you treat the temporary cessation of classes like a “working study break” and continue reading, studying, learning, writing papers, etc. Ask your professor or instructor for specific examples of what you can do to prepare for job action. Do this before August 11, the earliest date faculty could be locked out.\nIf you will not be in class until the fall semester, the best thing you can do is monitor the situation by checking our social media platforms (see below) and our website https://wearedal.ca.\nWhen classes resume, faculty will try to work out a revised completion of courses that is fair and reasonable. If work stoppage occurs, it could jeopardize the fall term depending on how long it lasts.\n\n\nIf I am travelling to start the fall term, should I still come to Halifax/Truro?\nDFA urges students to keep informed on how the situation is unfolding. Our picket lines will not prevent you from moving into residence although there could be delays while the picket lines are operating (Monday to Friday, 730 am – 400 pm).\nIf there is a lockout that begins in August, there is a high probability that the start of the fall semester will be delayed so you might want to plan your travel to campus accordingly. If you are considering changing your travel plans to Halifax, we advise sharing this information with Dalhousie’s student services leaders as this could encourage a faster resolution to the work stoppage.\n\n\nAs a student, is there anything I can do to help avoid labour disruption?\nThe Dalhousie Student Union is considering a motion for academic amnesty to the Senate for those students who might feel uncomfortable crossing picket lines to attend classes that may be held by sessional instructors.\nWe encourage you to voice your concerns to the Vice-Provost of Student Affairs Rick Ezekiel via email rick.ezekiel@dal.ca or Assistant Vice-Provost Student Engagement and Success Quenta Adams via email quenta.adams@dal.ca\nIf work stoppage occurs, and you see our DFA members walking the line, you are always welcome to show your support and join them on the picket lines.  We have no idea how long a lockout would last, and the more support we have on the picket lines, the stronger we will be."

    "title": "Student Update: Part 1",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is Part 1 of our Student Update, providing key information about the contract negotiations happening between Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) and the Dalhousie Board of Governors. Part 2 will be available in the coming weeks and is designed for those students wondering about the issues at the heart of this round of collective bargaining.\nThe Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) is the collective bargaining agent for almost 1000 faculty members at Dalhousie, including professors, instructors, librarians and counsellors.\n\n2025 Collective Bargaining\nThe DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors began negotiations on May 26, 2025. On June 2, after only a few days of bargaining, the Dalhousie Board unexpectedly filed for conciliation. The DFA contested the filing, saying it was too early in the process and full discussions on many proposals had not yet taken place. The Minister of Labour agreed to wait until the DFA Bargaining Team and the Board’s team met one last time on Friday, June 20, 2025.\nOn June 23, the Labour Board appointed Mr. Rick Rose as the conciliation officer. Conciliation begins July 9. Outstanding issues will be discussed during conciliation and we are unable to share details at this time. You have undoubtedly read much of the Board’s narrative about the financial situation they are in. Like most post-secondary institutions across Canada, Dalhousie is facing financial challenges that are created by several external factors beyond our direct control. In bargaining, the DFA has asked the Board to walk us through their current financial situation so that we can be certain that we understand exactly what these impacts look like today and in the near future. Several aspects of the operating budget remain mysterious and we await further explanation and clarification.\nThe DFA has conducted external reviews of Dalhousie’s Financial Statements for many years. The Board has a long-standing history of moving substantial funds out of the operating budget and into capital projects. Between 2003 and 2021, for example, Dalhousie’s audited financial statements show a cumulative operating surplus of more than $464M.\nEven if Dalhousie’s revenues are down as much as we are being told, there is plenty of money available to fund adequate cost-of-living adjustments for all Dalhousie employees, including professors, instructors, librarians and counsellors.\nThe Conciliation Process As is typical in bargaining, the conciliator meets with both sides to try and reach agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the conciliator files a “no board report” with the Minister of Labour, which triggers a 14-day countdown. At the end of that 14-day period, job action can begin, which means the Dalhousie Administration could lock out DFA faculty members, or the DFA could go on strike. Questions You May Have Are faculty members going to strike? And if so, when would it happen? From June 23 to July 4, the DFA held a strike vote. Over 85% of DFA members voted, and over 91% of those voting supported going on strike if necessary. This does not mean that there will be a strike, but rather that the faculty is prepared to go on strike if no agreement is reached during conciliation. The DFA Bargaining Team and leadership are committed to reaching a settlement without job action. We will continue bargaining in good faith and do our best to secure a fair agreement for our members without job action which causes unwanted disruption for faculty and students, alike. That said, at this point, the earliest you might expect job action (lock-out initiated by the Board of Governors, or strike initiated by the DFA) is mid-late August, which would allow the month of July for conciliation followed by the required 14 day-countdown period.\nIf there is a strike, how long will it last? There is no way to predict how long a strike would last. In the 47-year history of the DFA, there have been four strikes: 1985, 1988, 1998 and 2002. They ranged in length from one day (1985) to almost four weeks (2002). In the post-secondary sector in Canada, the average length of a strike is three weeks. It is important to note that DFA and the Board reached agreement in conciliation in 2012, 2017, 2020 and 2022.\nWhat activities would be interrupted? Job action (strike or lock-out) will interrupt specific activities including: in person classes, online classes, access to course materials, tests, grading, and communication with students on academic matters. These activities will all be interrupted.\n\n\nSenate will be suspended.\nSupervision of research students (both undergraduate and graduate) will be paused. Thesis defences, other presentations, and access to librarians will stop. There will be reduced access to some counseling services.\nInternships and practica might be disrupted depending on the specific details and supervisory responsibilities.\n\n\nThis will happen at all campuses.\nThe Administration may communicate to you additional programs and services that will be affected by job action. There will be physical pickets around campuses, so to get to the campus you may have to cross the picket line. Our faculty members will not prevent you from doing so. There will also be a significant social media presence, with posts and messaging related to the strike.\nHow can students keep their studies moving forward? In the event that a strike occurs this summer, many of you will not be in class. The best thing you can do is monitor the progress of the strike by checking our social media platforms and our website https://wearedal.ca If you are taking classes during the summer, we suggest that you treat the temporary cessation of classes like a “working study break” and continue reading, studying, learning, writing papers, etc. Many course instructors will provide specific examples of what to focus on prior to a strike. Because your workload may be more intense than normal after classes resume, stay current or ahead in your courses; at the end of a strike, faculty would try to work out a revised completion of courses that is fair and reasonable. Finally, although we cannot predict exactly how long a strike would last, we fully expect that you would have an opportunity to complete your courses. Both the DFA and the Dalhousie Administration have every motivation to make this possible."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Dave Westwood DFA President 2025-2026\nI apologize that it has taken me this long to write to you to provide some perspective and comments about this auspicious time in our history as a union. I think it is fair to say things have been a bit hectic. We are only a few days into the lockout, but already much has happened with plenty more yet to come.\nAs you probably suspect, I receive a considerable number of messages from Members in addition to ‘external’ supporters, detractors, and genuinely curious individuals who are simply trying to understand what is happening. Many of these messages have helped shape and clarify my view of the situation, strengthening my own convictions in some areas, and forcing me to reconsider some things as well.\nI have served as DFA President several times, but this is my first lockout (and strike!) and I am ready and keen to learn and adapt, as we all must. I try to be open and responsive to any and all feedback anyone wants to provide, and I encourage you to share with me what is on your mind.\nOne of the most important lessons I have learned is to have grace, and not in the sense of smooth and effortless movement. As I understand it, to have grace is to appreciate and recognize that people are trying to do their best at this very difficult, stressful, and confusing time, and one cannot and should not expect perfection, composure, and freedom from mistakes. We all make mistakes, and it would be a further mistake to interpret this as evidence of malice or nefarious intent. We are all learning during this very difficult and stressful time, and I hope that everyone involved in this labour disruption can find the grace to allow ourselves and others the space to express our ideas and emotions with as little judgment as possible.\nThis is not easy for any of us. After all, we are humans, not chatbots.\n\nWhat comes next?\nThanks to our strong ‘rejection’ vote, our bargaining team now has a clear and strong mandate to demand that the Board return to the table to negotiate a contract that will bring a conclusion to the labour dispute.\nWe have formally notified the Board that we are ready and willing to meet them whenever they have a substantially improved offer for us to consider, or if they wish to meet to discuss more creative or innovative solutions to the issues that we have identified as our concerns and priorities. Our conciliation officer Rick Rose remains assigned to our file, and will continue to assist us in reaching a new agreement. Unfortunately, the Board is under no obligation to return to the table in a timely manner. Like you, I would hope that our employer will see the value and indeed necessity of moving quickly to resolve the labour disruption. Every minute that passes threatens the start and success of the Fall semester for our students, and of course for us and our fellow workers at Dalhousie.\nWe have no interest in a lengthy labour dispute – our goal all along has been to negotiate a contract that we believe DFA Members would find acceptable given the information shared with us during the development of our bargaining proposals. There is no intrinsic value in a long labour disruption. That said, we are very well prepared to support every Member even if the lockout continues for many weeks or even months. Let’s all hope that is not required.\nKey updates will be shared regularly as bargaining continues. Things could move quickly, or there could be long periods of waiting. We must keep our spirits and energy strong during this phase as the excitement from the first week of the lockout dissipates and we enter what could be an attritional period where things might turn into a bit of a grinding affair.\nI have already been amazed and astonished by the enthusiasm and energy that I’ve seen on our picket lines, and I know that we have a huge amount of creative energy and talent to pour into this job action so I look forward to the clever, funny, creative, and passionate messages on picket signs and flooding social media.\n\n\nRespecting and valuing diverse opinions and perspectives\nWe are all the DFA.\nWhile the term ‘President’ might conjure images of a hierarchical structure of command and control – perhaps more so now than ever – I am the DFA President in title only. We have almost 1000 Members and each of us is an equal part of this union. No two of us have exactly the same experiences, personal history, or perspective on all or even any of the issues related to the current labour disruption.\nNobody in our union reports to me, or is required to take direction from me, and nor do I intend or expect that any of you should follow my lead or adopt my views about anything. We are all academics who are perfectly capable of forming our own opinions through gathering and analyzing evidence and information. In addition to our robust analytical skills and abilities, we are also human beings who experience emotions and react in different ways in the face of challenge and adversity.\nI say this because there will be times during this labour dispute that you might disagree strongly with opinions or expressions of emotions that you see or hear from one or more colleagues in the DFA.\nIn addition, the University is a place where we form numerous relationships and bonds with DFA colleagues but also other workers including those who occupy the most senior administrative positions at the University including the President herself. A labour dispute is particularly challenging when you have integrated relationships with the individuals on the other side of the table.\nIf you disagree with someone’s comments or perspective, I encourage you to engage in a respectful dialogue with that person to share your experience and to learn about their experience which likely differs from your own.\n\n\nMy own self-reflections\nAs DFA President, I have a responsibility to provide leadership at this time, and with that comes the opportunity or even requirement to speak as “the voice of the DFA” to the extent that this is (a) required, and (b) possible.\nMy goal is to try to remain focused on moving us toward our ultimate goal, which is to conclude a new collective agreement that is the best one possible for all DFA Members. I am trying to be as open, honest, and transparent as I can, and I am doing my best to be the kind of leader that you can trust and respect. As I mentioned above, I make mistakes, and when I look back at things that I have done or said I am not always pleased or proud of my actions.\nI acknowledge and recognize that in some of my remarks to you and in the media, I allowed my own emotions to become a part of my communication, and that I may have unfairly criticized individuals in the senior administration and questioned their underlying motives. I recognize that senior administrators are humans who are also under a lot of stress and pressure and who also make mistakes, and that they have jobs to do just as we do.\nThat said, let me be perfectly clear with you on one point because it directly relates to some of the strong emotional reactions that I see in our membership, including myself.\nWe have been locked out of our place of work by President Kim Brooks, and President Kim Brooks alone.\nShe has the sole authority to initiate this action, and she did not have to do it. While I have no doubt that this choice was informed by consultation with a variety of individuals within the management apparatus, at the end of the day the decision rested with a single individual.\nIf you attended our inaugural rally, or have read the media coverage surrounding the lockout of DFA Members, you will have learned or been reminded that lockouts in any sector are uncommon, and in higher education they are almost unheard of. Lockouts forever change the relationship between employer and employees.\nIt is true that a lockout is a legal part of labour relations, in the same way that a strike is, but there is a very important and I would argue critical difference between the two that makes a lockout far more significant.\nUnionized employees that legally withdraw their labour during a strike do no direct personal harm to the employer. They are choosing to use one of the very few tools of power at their disposal to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment. When they initiate a strike, they do so with the recognition that they will surrender their own income for some period of time.\nIn contrast, employers that legally lock out their employees have chosen to do direct personal harm to those individuals by withholding the income that they depend upon to support themselves and their families.\nWhen President Kim Brooks locked us out, she did so with the knowledge that it would cause direct personal harm to each and every one of us, and it was a conscious and calculated choice to take this action “in the best interests of the institution”. It is entirely possible that anyone acting as President of Dalhousie University might have reached the same conclusion, but the fact is that it was a particular individual that took this action at a particular moment in time, and that person needs to own and be held accountable for that decision.\nSo, when I see and hear colleagues expressing strong emotions, I understand and recognize where this comes from.\nAll of this said, I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that personal or ad hominem attacks are appropriate, necessary, or helpful.\nSuch attacks are not and will not be a part of the DFA bargaining strategy.\nWe have been attacked, and hurt, but I believe the best way forward at this time is to continue generating pressure on the entire Board of Governors so that they bring an offer to the table that we can accept.\n\n\nWhat can we do at this time to reach a satisfactory conclusion?\nNow that we are into a labour disruption, I think it is imperative that we all do our best to support and encourage each other. If the dispute lasts a considerable length of time we will all begin to feel many forms of pressure, not the least of which is financial as essential expenses like groceries, rent, mortgage payments, and health needs come due. The strength of a union is the people in it, and we will need to lean on each other as pressure begins to mount. (NOTE: If you need to contact your financial institution to request a temporary relief of payments, click here for a template letter.)\nMuch of our media exposure to date has been ‘centrally controlled and managed’, and for good reason. We wanted to be sure that traditional media outlets were able to share accurate and timely information with key stakeholders such as students and their families. This helps to create pressure on the Board, as students begin to recognize that significant disruptions are about to occur to their plans for education at Dalhousie. You can help us to amplify this pressure through your own personal channels including social media. The kinds of messages that create maximum pressure on the Board are those that create awareness amongst students and their families that the longer this dispute drags on, the greater the impact on their academic year in terms of when it might start, when it might end, and what amount of content might be lost if the term needs to be cut short because of a protracted labour dispute. When discussing the issues at stake in our collective bargaining, I encourage all DFA Members to speak openly and honestly about your own personal context. The issues that we are fighting for resonate with our fellow workers: catching wages up to high levels of inflation and cost of living, protecting good quality jobs for future generations, helping new workers to cope with the disproportionate impact of the wage/cost-of-living gap, fighting against the precarity of work that has seen an abuse of contract-based employment that allows employers to make employees disposable even though the work that is required is essential and continuing. For many of us, myself included, the fight at this time is for others in the who are facing more difficult circumstances. I have heard loud and clear that those most in need of our collective strength at this time are our early-career colleagues, and our colleagues that are being exploited through continued precarious contracts.\n\n\nFinal remarks\nA labour disruption is a time to come together, and it can be a great time to organize and build collective power for the future. There is a unique energy and excitement during a labour disruption, and we get to interact and mingle with our fellow union members in ways that just do not happen at any other time. I encourage everyone to make the most of this rare moment to build solidarity, and to talk about and take note of ways that we can build on our newfound strength after this dispute is resolved. Once we settle into a routine with our picket lines and activities, I would love to see spontaneous events, gatherings, and social activities that help us to forge strong and lasting bonds with each other. There is strength in a union, and that strength is us.\nSincerely,\n\nDave Westwood DFA President 2025-2026"

    "title": "Dalhousie Board gives Faculty Members 48-hour Notice to Lockout",
    "section": "",
    "text": "(Monday, August 18, 2025 – Halifax, NS) – The Dalhousie Board of Governors issued its 48-hour notice to the Minister of Labour this morning, allowing the Board to lockout almost 1000 faculty who are members of the Dalhousie Faculty Association. The lockout could begin any time effective Wednesday, August 20, 2025.\n“This move by the Administration is reckless and will damage the reputation of the institution,” notes DFA President David Westwood. “Faculty members can’t apply for research grants, we have to pause our research, students will be second-guessing their decision to come to Dalhousie. A lockout affects every aspect of the teaching and research that happens at Dalhousie.”\nMonday, August 11, was the final meeting with provincially-appointed Conciliation Officer Rick Rose to find a tentative agreement between the two sides. The Board tabled their final offer at 10 am on August 11, and then walked away from the meeting at 12 noon without notifying the conciliator. On August 14, DFA held a virtual meeting with its DFA membership to present the Board’s final offer. Immediately following the meeting, DFA launched an e-vote on the offer, with the vote closing Thursday, August 21. The Board was advised of this timeline, yet they still announced a lockout that would occur before the voting is even completed.\n“It is important to note that this is a labour disruption initiated by the employer, not by the union,” notes Westwood. “We have been clear all along that our objective is to negotiate at the table. We want to work, and we have a lot of preparations to get ready for the fall term which will not get done if the Board goes ahead with their lockout plan. It is beyond irresponsible for the Board to suggest to students with any confidence that there will be little to no disruption to the Fall semester. By triggering a lockout during preparations for the Fall term, every minute of a lockout translates to a minute of postponement to the start of the Fall term. Whenever this labour disruption is resolved, that lost time will need to be accounted for.”\nNo other university in the “U15” has ever locked out its faculty. U15 Canada is an association of the 15 leading research universities across the country, of which Dalhousie is a member. “Throughout this entire round of bargaining the Board has been uncharacteristically aggressive in its approach and unwilling to negotiate in any meaningful way on the items of most importance to our members,” notes Westwood. “A lockout would demonstrate their complete lack of respect for our faculty, Dalhousie students, and the bargaining process.”\nOne key issue remaining on the bargaining table is the Board’s continued reliance on limited-term contracts for long-term continuing teaching needs. Another issue is making sure that wages keep pace with dramatic increases in the cost of living in Nova Scotia, a common issue confronted by every worker in this province.\n“DFA is asking for wages that keep up with inflation and make up for 9% loss in real wages we have incurred over the past 10 years,” says Westwood. “We are also fighting to keep full-time jobs from being converted to sessional contracts. If our Members had not pushed back, the Board would have pressed forward with their proposal to make 76 of our Members vulnerable to conversion to sessional contracts.”\nOther issues include expanding access to childcare and ensuring workloads are fair and reasonable.\nThe current agreement between DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors expired June 30, 2025. Negotiations began the last week of May, and after only four bargaining meetings, the Board of Governors filed for conciliation on June 2. One more bargaining meeting was held June 20, and then Rick Rose was appointed as the conciliation officer on June 23. Three conciliation meetings were held in July and the Board walked away from conciliation prematurely. Rose filed his report on June 28, triggering a 14-day waiting period which ended August 11.\nIn June, 85.5% of the DFA membership participated in a strike vote. Of those, 91.2% voted in favour of going on strike if an acceptable deal could not be reached. Now that the Board has presented its final offer, the DFA will meet with its full membership to review the final offer on the table. Members are currently voting on the Board’s most recent offer. The vote closes end of day Thursday, August 21. DFA’s Bargaining Bulletins can be found here.\n\nAbout DFA\nThe DFA is the certified bargaining agent for almost 1,000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors at Dalhousie University. As a volunteer-based organization, we advocate for the rights of our members and work to protect and advance the academic integrity of the University.\nTo arrange an interview with DFA President David Westwood: email DFA Communications Officer Catherine.Wall@dal.ca"

We’re all very happy to see the province get a soaking but, as it turns out, a lot of us were also happy to show the strength of our resolve in the weather!While the office tried to call people in when the rain became especially heavy, some members wiped the rain off and said “Hell no! We won’t go!” and stayed on the line. One of our friendly neighbourhood Bulletin editors drove by the line during the rush-hour tempest and was pleased to hear the sound of their horn drowned out by all of the others! \n\n\n\nPicket Line News and Updates\nA few points that our intrepid Job Action office wants us to pass on that we hope will reassure everyone and gear them up for the week!\n\nAn email should be coming today with reminders of the details on the pay rates and schedule. A reminder that if you have any trouble with pay once it’s gone out, to please contact the amazing Kristin Hearn in the DFA office: kristin.hearn@dal.ca. Remember, even though we only picket 5 days a week, we get paid for 7!\nWe’ve also had inquiries from people on our virtual duties campaign: thank you for your patience! We are getting things up and running, and we will be back in touch soon. In the meantime, you will be paid like everyone else, not to worry!\nThere is a Lost and Found in the SUB for Halifax picketers.\nLast but the opposite of least: a Call for Shout-Outs! We received this great idea from member Sarah Jane Dooley: a “Shout Out Series!” If you know someone on the picket line who’s been keeping spirits high, spreading positivity, or showing up with extra heart, then send us a quick shout-out for the newsletter. Let’s celebrate the folks who make this movement stronger every day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolidarity and Support\nToday’s “solidarity and support” comes from parents of the students who are currently arriving to Dalhousie, only to find they have no idea when their term will start. This time of year is usually busy for all the members of our union, but without even trying we often share in the sheer excitement of students on their arrival at campus.\n\nThis year feels different because of the President’s decision to lock us out and the Board’s refusal to bargain. The parents of those students recognize this fact, as you can see in the letter that has been sent to President Brooks from parents in Halifax, elsewhere in Nova Scotia, Ontario, and maybe further.\n\nHere’s the form letter. Know a Dalhousie parent who might appreciate it? Feel free to share. \n\n“As parents of an incoming [insert Faculty or program] student, we have been watching the contract dispute between Dal and the DFA unfold.\n\n”I understand we do not have all of the background, financial details or information that the board does, but as a tuition payer expecting to pay MANY thousands of dollars over the next several years, we respectfully request that the board return to negotiations and/or agree to arbitration with DFA as soon as possible. \n\n“It is unfair to use current and future students, as well as research grants and projects, as pawns in this chess game. Paying thousands of dollars per semester is stressful enough without the uncertainty of knowing if there will be classes to attend, credits to achieve, or if schedules will be upended and study breaks nullified.\n\n”PLEASE return to talks with the DFA, now, so a contract can be negotiated before the start of the school year.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\nStay tuned for details about Friday’s rally event: we don’t want to spill the beans before things are set, but we’re trying to cook something up!\nIn our previous issue, we mentioned the Solidarity Hub in Halifax at the SUB, and we wanted to pass on details from our wonderful counsellor colleagues:\n\n\nDFA Job Action Solidarity Hub\nWe know that recent events may be bringing up a range of emotions for our DFA members. In this time of uncertainty, the DFA is setting up a Job Action Solidarity Hub to support one another through collective care and radical rest.\n\nLocation: Strike Headquarters, Student Union Building (SUB), Room 302\nHours: Open daily during job action from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM\n\nThis space is designed to be a welcoming, supportive environment where members can:\n\nGather information regarding mental health resources that are available for DFA members\nLearn strategies to prevent burnout during this challenging period\nConnect with colleagues in a spirit of solidarity\nShare experiences and emotions around the current situation\nEnjoy refreshments before or after picket duty\nLeave and receive uplifting messages on our anonymous “collective care” message board.\n\nWellness activities will be offered regularly. \nSpecial guests: Risser and Luna, DFA’s own therapy dogs will be stopping by now and then for some much-needed four-legged furry support!\nAll DFA members are warmly welcome.\n\n\nSolidarity Hub Schedule (Week of August 25)\nWe will have the following suggested events this week. Please join us for some light refreshments and collective care! We have “themes” but you are always welcome to inquire about topics of interest to you. We are here to support each other! \n\nTUESDAY: Drop In Cookie Decorating! Theme of the day will be discussing the “new normal” and creating a routine during the strike.\nWEDNESDAY: Luna the Therapy Dog! Theme of the day will be talking about burnout and self care.\nTHURSDAY: Risser the Therapy Dog! Theme of the day will be a discussion around coping during these stressful times.\nFRIDAY: Drop in tea/coffee before rally. Discussion based on what is brought up by attendees (how to work through emotions, processing experiences, needs, etc)."

Have an idea for something to cover? Let us know at dfa.daily.bulletin@gmail.com.\n\n\nAugust 22nd Rally!\nThe last time our union held a job action rally was twenty-three years ago, but we haven’t lost our touch! This past Friday over 300 people (members and supporters, including students, representatives from other Dalhousie unions, other local, provincial, and national unions, and community members) gathered outside the Killam Library to make our voices heard! And make them heard we did! As President Dave Westwood said in his recent message, “our bargaining team now has a clear and strong mandate to demand that the Board return to the table to negotiate a contract.”\n\n\n\nPicket News and New Schedules!\nIt looks like rain is coming, which is good news for the province! But keep an eye on the weather and dress appropriately for the lines (there are a limited number of ponchos available).\n\nYou should have all received an email over the weekend with a new survey asking for your availability for pickets in September. Make sure to ask colleagues on your line if they received theirs, so we can catch anyone whose survey went to their junk folder, or had other technical glitches. Find someone who didn’t get it? Just forward the email to them! Thank you!\n\n\nSolidarity and Support\nMore than two dozen academic and public sector unions from across the entire country have donated to our cause, for a growing total of over $35,000! We’ve also received important support from other unions, including the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour and theNova Scotia Teachers Union, among many others. We’ll keep updating the list available here so you can all see the wealth of support for our cause! We also received organizing and other supports from CAUT and our sibling Dalhousie unions of NSGEU and CUPE 3912, who issued statements and were represented at our rally. Solidarity is how we will all win fair contracts!\n\n\n\nBargaining Update\nWith our overwhelming rejection of the Board’s entirely underwhelming offer, we have sent the ball back to their court. As of this writing (Sunday night, Aug 24), there has been no update from the Board. In fact, there has been no communication from administration since President Kim Brooks locked us out on Wednesday! Hopefully we hear from their team soon that they are coming back to the table. Until then, maybe we should start a new game show: “Where in the World is President Brooks?!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\nWe are planning some great activities and supports for our members. Some of our counsellor colleagues will be setting up in the Solidarity Hub at the Student Union Building: stay tuned for more details, but feel free to stop by the Hub for a snack and a chat! And don’t forget, we’ll be holding rallies every Friday: let’s see if we can break our attendance record from last week! Time and location to follow."

    "section": "",
    "text": "(Tuesday, July 29, 2025 – Halifax, NS) – Conciliation Officer Rick Rose has filed his “no board report” with the Minister of Labour, indicating a bargaining impasse and triggering a 14-day countdown before legal job action can take place between Dalhousie Board of Governors and Dalhousie Faculty Association. “Our union has no intention of initiating a strike in August,” says DFA President David Westwood. “If there is any labour disruption before the start of the fall semester, it will have been because Dalhousie’s Board of Governors chose to lock out our professors, instructors, professional counsellors and librarians.”\nNow that the conciliator has filed his report, a 14-day countdown begins before either side could initiate labour action, subject to providing a minimum of 48 hours’ notice. “I reached out to Dalhousie President Kim Brooks yesterday requesting a face-to-face conversation to ensure that the administration is fully aware of the serious consequences of a lockout leading into the fall semester. At this point the question is ‘What will it take to reach an agreement?’,” notes Westwood. “We are prepared to negotiate, and I hope that the Board understands that they will need to improve their offer to get a deal done. While I hope that the Board does not intend to actually lock out our members, their posturing so far has suggested that they wanted to be in precisely this position at this point in time.”\nThe two sides are scheduled for one last-minute conciliation session on August 11. If no tentative agreement is reached, the Board could lockout all members of the faculty association on August 12. This includes almost 1000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors. The current agreement between DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors expired June 30, 2025. Negotiations began the last week of May, and after only four bargaining meetings, the Board of Governors filed for conciliation on June 2. One more bargaining meeting was held June 20, and then Rick Rose was appointed as the conciliation officer on June 23, 2025. Conciliation meetings were held July 9, 15 and 16, 2025. The Board walked away from conciliation prematurely. Earlier this month, 85.5% of the DFA membership participated in a strike vote. Of those, an overwhelming 91.2% voted in favour of going on strike if an acceptable deal cannot be reached.\nThere are many outstanding issues on the table that have yet to be agreed. They include: wages that account for cost-of-living increases and are on par with the pattern in the sector, preventing full-time jobs from becoming precarious sessional contracts; ending the practice of using limited-term contracts for continuing teaching needs; expanding access to childcare and ensuring workloads are fair and reasonable.\nDFA’s Bargaining Bulletins can be found here.\n\nAbout DFA\nThe DFA is the certified bargaining agent for almost 1,000 professors, instructors, librarians and professional counsellors at Dalhousie University. As a volunteer-based organization, we advocate for the rights of our members and work to protect and advance the academic integrity of the University.\nTo arrange an interview with DFA President David Westwood: email DFA Communications Officer Catherine.Wall@dal.ca"

It’s time for the Board to come back to the table with something that our members can seriously consider.”\nA record 93.4% (930 out of 981) of the DFA Membership participated in the vote which opened Thursday, August 14."

    "title": "Student Update: Part 2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This second update provides students with key information about the contract negotiations happening between Dalhousie Faculty Association (DFA) and the Dalhousie Board of Governors. This gives an overview of the issues at the heart of this round of collective bargaining.\nDFA wants to continue bargaining, but Dalhousie Board of Governors has so far not accepted our invitation to come back to the table. If you have concerns about how this situation will affect the fall term, please contact:\nVice-Provost Student Affairs\nDr. Rick Ezekiel\nrick.ezekiel@dal.ca\n902-494-8021\nAssistant Vice-Provost Student Engagement and Success Quenta Adams quenta.adams@dal.ca 902-494-1924 \nBargaining Highlights As explained in Student Update Part 1, the DFA and the Dalhousie Board of Governors (the Board) began negotiations on May 26, 2025. On June 2, after only a few days of bargaining, the Board filed for conciliation. The DFA contested the filing, saying it was premature and full discussions on many proposals had not yet taken place. The Minister of Labour agreed to wait until the DFA Bargaining Team and the Board’s team met one last time on June 20.\nOn June 23, the Labour Board appointed a conciliation officer and conciliation meetings were held July 9, July 15 and July 16. Midway through the July 16 session, the Board presented a ‘best and final offer’ and withdrew from further discussions, leaving several outstanding matters unresolved, despite progress being made.\nAs is typical in bargaining, the conciliator meets with both sides to try and reach agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the conciliator files a “no board report” with the Minister of Labour, which triggers a 14-day countdown. At the end of that 14-day period, the employer could lock out employees or the union could go on strike.\nIn DFA’s case, the conciliator is scheduled to file a “no board report” on July 28, which means the Board could lock out faculty members at midnight on Monday, August 11 at the earliest. We are concerned that the Board’s procedural choices and rapid escalation signal a lockout strategy. The DFA will not initiate a strike in August.\nThe Main Issues Typically, in conciliation, the two sides discuss the few remaining items not agreed to in bargaining. We were making progress in several areas including moving expenses, Indigenous ceremonial leave and some workload proposals. However, because the Board filed for conciliation prematurely, and walked away from conciliation while DFA was still ready to bargain, these items and many others are still on the table.\nSalary The DFA is currently proposing a salary increase (also known as the Income Maintenance Change, or IMC) of: 7% in the first year; 4% in the second and 4% in the third. We moved from our initial proposal of 9%, 6% and 6%. The Board is offering 2% in each year, up only .25% a year from their original offer before conciliation.\nIt is important to note that the Board’s salary offer is tied to a major change in the 90-10 Clause (see p. 3) that would allow the Board to employ more sessional instructors to replace work normally done by DFA Members. They are not offering a conditions-free cost-of-living adjustment. The Board’s proposal of an increase close to the expected level of inflation depends on accepting a dramatic change to the academic staffing at the institution. This change would affect DFA members who could lose their jobs, and it would impact the student experience, as more sessional (part time) instructors will be teaching your courses.\nFor the past year, the Board has talked about the grave financial situation facing Dalhousie. The DFA has asked the Board on several occasions to help us understand the financial situation and its impact on operations. Despite our requests, we have not received adequate explanation and we are concerned with the apparent lack of a plan to ensure the integrity of the academic programs at Dalhousie. Several aspects of the operating budget lack transparency or detailed explanation. The Board has a long history of moving substantial funds out of the operating budget and into capital projects to fund things like buildings and the new arena. Between 2003 and 2021, Dalhousie’s financial statements show a cumulative operating surplus of more than $464M, yet they are now somehow facing a significant deficit that they are using to implement extreme operational cutbacks. Dalhousie’s historical surpluses and discretionary capital expenditures suggest sufficient flexibility to fund cost-of-living adjustments for academic staff. Over the past three Collective Agreements, the salary increases negotiated with the Board have fallen short of inflation. As a result, DFA Members have in essence, incurred a wage cut of almost 9% in real terms over the past decade.\nFor five years the Board offered salary increases below 2% (the normal expected level of inflation). Then, in the years when the Board agreed to raises above 2%, inflation was much higher than expected (e.g., up to 7.53% in 2022). In this 2025 round of bargaining, salary increases must make up for the 9% accumulated wage cut and ensure that we do not slide further behind the expected increase in cost of living.\nIt is the Board’s responsibility to pay fair wages to the employees who do the critical work of the institution. Fair wages help us keep pace with the cost of living in Nova Scotia. It is the only way to continue recruiting top quality faculty.\nThe 90-10 Clause The 90-10 clause – dating back to 1978 - ensures that no less than 90% of the teaching is done by DFA Members, with a maximum of 10% allocated to non-DFA Members (e.g., CUPE 3912 sessional instructors and non-unionized instructors). The Board is proposing a change to the 90-10 clause that would allow them to eliminate up to 76 full-time, tenure/tenure track faculty positions, and and increase their reliance on precarious, lower-paid academic staff.\nThe 90-10 rule protects the integrity and quality of academic work at Dalhousie, and enables the DFA to protect the working conditions of the majority of academic staff at the institution. It is fundamental to our purpose and values as a faculty association.\nLibrarian Appointments and Workload The Board proposes to change the way librarians are appointed, from being appointed to a specific to an appointment to the library system. So, our librarians could be in the Law Library one term, and in the Health Sciences Library the next; in the MacRae Library in Truro one year and the Killam in Halifax the next. No specialty, no consistency. The Board also proposes to remove provisions for librarian workload, including overtime.\nChild Care and Parental Leave All of the DFA proposals targeted to improve working conditions for less senior faculty with families remain on the table. To date, the Board has declined to support any of the DFA’s proposals in this area, including: improving child care, extending parental leave top-up and academic scheduling to address caregiver responsibilities.\nAbuse of Limited-Term Appointments (LTAs) The Board has not been willing to discuss converting LTAs that have existed for over five years. Some of our DFA members have been in limited-term positions since as far back as 2008.\nIndigenous Leave The Board has not agreed to adequate leave for Indigenous members to engage in days of importance, traditional, and cultural Indigenous practices, and ceremonies and celebrations.\nHealth Spending Account Despite a majority of DFA members using the maximum amount of their Health Spending Account, the Board has not agreed to an increase despite the growing needs of members.\nRetirement Incentive The Board has no interest in discussing a retirement incentive program, even though it would save money in its budget. Paying senior faculty is far more expensive than paying those early in their career.\nProfessional Counsellors: Cost of Professional Fees and Workload The Board will not discuss covering the costs of professional fees for Professional Counsellors who are hired to provide important mental health services for students that require them to be licensed. Additionally, the Board won’t discuss proper hours of work for Professional Counsellors.\nAugust Disruption Jeopardizes the Fall Term A lockout in August causes significant disruption for not only faculty, but for students and their families, and puts the success of the fall term in jeopardy. Students attending classes over the summer will have their studies interrupted, move-in dates may be affected, even the decision of whether or not to come to Dalhousie or continue your studies at our university could be impacted. Faculty are being forced to shift their focus from preparing your courses to contingency planning , a consequence of the unresolved bargaining situation. The DFA Bargaining Team remains ready and willing to bargain, and we encourage the Board to come back to the table."
